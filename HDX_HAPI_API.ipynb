        "ICPAC Countries Data Fetching Script (HDX)\n",
        "Overview\n",
        "This script is designed to download CSV files related to specific ICPAC countries from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) and organize them into separate folders for each country. The ICPAC countries included are Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania.\n",
        "\n",
        "Script Enhancements\n",
        "The script has been enhanced with several features to ensure robust data fetching and organization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Enhanced Logging: The script now includes print statements that log the process of fetching data for each country. This helps in tracking which country's data is being processed and whether datasets are found.\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling: Added try-except blocks around the requests.get calls to handle potential HTTP errors and other exceptions. This ensures that the script can handle issues gracefully and provides meaningful error messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modified Search Parameters: Adjusted the search parameters to include a simple query for the country name (q) and a filter for CSV resources (fq). This change aims to improve the relevance of the search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Directory Structure: For each ICPAC country, a directory is created to store the corresponding CSV files. This organization helps in maintaining a clear structure for the downloaded data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Download Function: The function download_file is used to handle the downloading of files. It checks the response status and writes the content to a file in chunks to handle large files efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage\n",
        "The script automatically create a directory named hdx_csv_files with subdirectories for each ICPAC country, where the downloaded CSV files will be stored."
