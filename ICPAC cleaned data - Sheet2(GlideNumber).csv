The incident led to a massive fire and the release of dense black smoke, visible from a considerable distance. Swiftly, firefighters arrived at the scene, while several tanker trucks departed from the depot, escorted by soldiers and police for protection. Even after the firefighters successfully brought the fire under control later in the day, a thick column of smoke and some flames remained visible. It is worth noting that Guinea does not produce oil and lacks oil refining capabilities. Instead, it relies on importing refined products, which are primarily stored in the Kaloum terminal and distributed throughout the country via trucks.

The current extent of the damage sustained by the terminal remains uncertain at this moment. However, this unfortunate incident has resulted in the loss of both lives and properties. The initial report on human casualties indicates that there are at least 12 fatalities, 190 individuals injured, and several people still missing. The injured have been promptly evacuated to Donka and Ignace Deen hospitals, while the deceased have been transported to the respective morgues. The current situation does not provide a definite count of the displaced individuals and the overall number of affected people.

This was the first time that the capital city of Sudan, home to 6 million people, was at the epicentre of a fierce conflict between two powerful groups, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). 

Clashes broke out in different areas of the country and the relentless urban conflict has now taken at least 459  lives, many of them civilians, and injured over 5,000 people. 

Millions of civilians caught in the crossfire have been in lockdown for nearly two weeks, and many have run out of basic supplies like food, water, and medicine, having instead to borrow them or take the risk of fleeing through extremely dangerous routes. 

The conflict has also taken a significant toll on public infrastructure, with the destruction of hospitals and health facilities, leaving only 16 percent  of these facilities operating regularly in Khartoum. Residential buildings, water infrastructure, and energy infrastructure have been damaged as well, with continued disruption of service, while communications and internet connectivity have also been compromised. Both private and public facilities have been ransacked, and some burnt down, including on the premises of SRCS.  

The latest ceasefire has partially held, allowing evacuations to take place and some families to restock. However, food and water shortages, and lack of fuel, are leading to sharp increases in the cost of these basic commodities, while the price of transportation out of conflict areas is unaffordable for many. Families are prioritising the evacuation of women and children, who are exposed to heightened risks including sexual and gender-based violence, as reported by women-led organisations in Sudan . 

After 15 days of uninterrupted fighting, the full extent of the humanitarian situation is yet to be determined, but to date this conflict has put at least 9 million Sudanese, chiefly those living near the clashes, under severe hardship, unable to access emergency healthcare or medicines for those suffering from chronic conditions. The health facilities that remain functional lack staff and equipment, and the available blood is at risk due to power cuts in the cold chain. Women who are about to give birth cannot access ante-natal care and may be at risk of delivering without medical supervision. Lack of access to potable water is also leading people to seek water from the Nile, which could lead to a spike in diarrhoeal diseases, and will have repercussions on the nutrition status of children and pregnant and lactating women. 

Widespread displacement is ongoing, mainly in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur. There are chaotic scenes in Port Sudan and Wadi Halfa bordering Egypt, with people stranded for several days at a time attempting to leave the country. Displacement has also affected refugees living in Sudan, with many sheltering in crowded camps in White Nile State, Gedaref, and Kassala. People are also fleeing to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Central African Republic (CAR)."

The Malakal cholera update of 11 March 2023 reported a total of 265 cholera cases including one death have been reported from Malakal, Upper Nile State. Most of the cases are males (147/55%) while 118 accounting for 45% are females. Overall, case patients between 0-4years old are mostly affected. Since February, the curve of children under 4 have represent between 91% to 95% of the reported cases. On 7th March the children from 0 to 4 years were already 170 (95%) of the 179 cases reported. Of these, 109 (61%) are from Malakal Town, while 70 (39%) are from Malakal Protection of Civilians Sites (POC).  The Malakal PoC site was born out of the civil war that started in South Sudan on 15 December 2013. At the time, civilians were fleeing from indiscriminate and deliberate attacks and their only place of refuge was the UNMISS Base in Malakal. To date, it remains a crucial safe haven for 34,056 IDPs/civilians (source: DRC April 2021 population head count) who still perceive the security environment outside the PoC site as unsafe, with the PoC site continuing to serve as a critical coping mechanism for populations facing risk in Malakal and beyond.

With the positive PCR test result, the Ministry of Health hereby declared a confirmed outbreak of cholera in Malakal, Upper Nile State, South Sudan on 7th March 2023, and issued situation report number one."

The suspected cases reported increased from 136 cases in Week 1 of 2023 to 253 cases. 

As of March 2, 2023, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recorded again further increase of the disease. In total of 733 suspected cases, including 89 deaths (CFR 12.3%) with children between the ages of 5 and 18 are the age group most afflicted. The overall case fatality rate is (12.3). World Health Organization (WHO) latest data received from ProMed, reported that 20 states are currently reported suspected cases in Nigeria, with the majority of cases reported from Kano (74%), Yobe (12%), Katsina (6%), Sokoto (2%), Enugu ( 1%), Ogun ( 1%), Osun (1%), Kaduna (1%), Lagos (1%), and Zamfara (1%) states. Osun  and lagos state has high cases of zero dose children who are at risk of diphtheria. This outbreak has been labelled as one of the most recently severe outbreaks of diphtheria in Nigeria in recent years. 

Diphtheria is a disease that affects most people without the vaccine, and the NCDC reports that out of the suspected cases, only 27 (12.5%) out of 216 confirmed cases were fully vaccinated with a diphtheria toxin-containing vaccine. There have been laboratory-confirmed cases in addition to clinically suspected cases, and the NCDC is collaborating with state health departments and partners to improve surveillance and response to the outbreak. NCDC has been working with stakeholders to increase the awareness of the disease, however the cases continues to increase. 

NCDC was first notified of suspected diphtheria cases in Kano and Lagos states on December 1, 2022. On January 20, 2023, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) officially declared the situation as an outbreak of Diphtheria cases in Lagos and Kano States, which were the first to confirm Diphtheria cases. Diphtheria quickly spread to other states. 

The National technical working group multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate the response activities at all level. With the alarming trend, Zamfara state also requested National Society assistance in the emergency action to reduce the huge burden on the health care services in the state."
CE-2023-000033-TGO,https://glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/details.jsp?glide=22809&record=66&last=1985,Complex Emergency,Togo,"The Savannah region bordering Burkina Faso has been plagued by incursions from non-state armed groups on the Burkinabe side of the border with several attacks since 2021. 
These attacks have multiplied since February, leading the Government on 17 February 2023 to request support from the CRT and its other partners for assistance to displaced populations. On that date, the death toll from the crisis was
- 102 dead and 15 injured.
- 2,037 displaced households, approximately 12,222 people including IDPs and Burkinabe populations.
* 1403 Burkinabe households in refuge in Togo.
* 634 internally displaced households.

New attacks continue to be recorded according to reports from branches on the ground. But access to information and data sharing remains an important challenge to define actions in real time. In addition, a certain degree of discretion at local level did not facilitate the clear identification of the number of displaced persons by the NS. In light of this, the CRT conducted a situation update mission, reporting 22,000 people affected by the crisis, including 8,857 IDPs including refugees and 13,861 host populations. 

The situation of the branches also shows that the villages attacked are mainly in the North East of the Savannah region and on the Burkinabe border, while the populations have found refuge in the more secure villages in the South of the Savannah region. The main places of refuge include: the Prefecture of Kpendjal in majority (Kpenjal- West in majority), the Prefecture of Tône, the Prefecture of Manjouaré (in the town of Majouaré), the Prefecture of Oti (mainly in Oti-Sud), and Cinkassé in the Savannes region.

The displaced are received daily by tens to hundreds in the above-mentioned localities. The current number of displaced persons is said to exceed the above figures by tens of thousands. The displaced persons are said to be fleeing from the attacks, but they are also fleeing following warnings within the communities of possible attacks, whether or not they are actually planned. The populations found refuge in host families in villages located more than 20 km from their original residences. 

Most of the population moved on foot or on carts with their few pieces of luggage, leaving behind their granaries, poultry and small ruminants. It should be remembered that the majority of these displaced persons arrived in host families without the minimum of facilities for their integration.  This forced the host families to share their food reserves with their hosts. Today, it is difficult to eat the 3 daily meals. The consumption of pets has started to increase.
Among the displaced there is a high percentage of children under 11 years old (about 30%) who are psychologically affected by the atrocities and the change of life. 
 
Access to the villages of origin to consider a return is no longer possible or at least remains a challenge as the security situation remains volatile with explosive devices buried on the roads. This is the case, where on 2 February, 10 people on board a tricycle fell victim to an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) at a place called Inamoufali. No survivors were noted as the convoy headed to the cemeteries to bury the four peasants murdered the day before.  In addition, there were reports of infiltration into the existing groups of people in the host villages."
EP-2023-000027-GNQ,https://glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/details.jsp?glide=22803&record=67&last=1985,Epidemic,Equatorial Guinea,"From January 7th to February 6th, 2023 the Ministry of Health of Equatorial Guinea identified a cluster of deaths in two remote districts of the continental region of Equatorial Guinea (Nosrk Nsomo and Ebebiyim) where a total of 9 deaths occurred with similar symptoms related to viral hemorrhagic fever. Equatorial Guinea currently does not have laboratory capacity to test for VHF, hence samples from those who were sick and from close contacts were sent to Gabon and Senegal. The samples sent for testing in Gabon were negative, but the out of the eight samples sent to Dakar, Senegal, one tested positive for Marburg virus. 

On 13 February 2023, the Equatorial Guinea MoH officially declared the outbreak. (https://www.afro.who.int/countries/equatorial-guinea/news/equatorial-guinea-confirms-first-ever-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak) 

As of 17 February, 1 case is confirmed, 8 are probable (deaths from individuals with VHF symptoms that were not tested) and 16 suspect cases in isolation (2 are showing signs and symptons). 21 additional are considered secondary contacts. There is restricted access to Kie Ntem district, with an estimated 4,235 people in quarantine.  

The affected district is located in the north-east of Equatorial Guinea mainland, bordering Cameroon and Gabon. Several suspected cases were identified in Cameroon, but all samples were negative for Marburg virus. There is no notification of cases or symptoms related to Marburg on the Gabonese territory.

Marburg Virus Disease (MVM) is a highly virulent disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, with a case fatality rate of up to 88%. It belongs to the same family of viruses that causes Ebola virus disease. The disease caused by the Marburg virus begins abruptly, with a high fever, severe headache and severe malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic symptoms within seven days. The virus is transmitted to humans by fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the body fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the virus. However, supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms improves survival.

The Marburg outbreak declared on 13 February 2023 is the first VHF outbreak in Equatorial Guinea. At present, the epidemiological situation is as follows: 
•	1 case confirmed, 9 deaths (8 probable cases, 1 confirmed), 16 suspect cases in isolation, 2 of those in isolation are showing signs and symptoms. 21 are considered “secondary contacts” and in isolation at home.  
•	Estimated 4,325 people in quarantine and restricted access to Kie Ntem District. 
However, given the low levels of contact tracing, the reduced number of samples collected, the lack of testing capacity in country, the time required to collect and send samples to other countries, and the delays in obtaining results, these numbers may not reflect entirely the reality of the outbreak. The attack rate is also considerably high, at 23% for relatives and 81% for those providing direct care to infected persons when precautions are not strictly practiced. Moreover, case fatality ratios from past outbreaks have ranged from 24% to 88%, depending on the case management.  The above, associated with the time elapsed between the identification of the first symptoms (7 January) and the  confirmation of the virus (13 February), considerably heightens the potential of widespread infection, and poses challenges to the response and overall control of a very virulent outbreak. 

According to government information, initial alerts and deaths have been traced  back to public events which, according to local religious and cultural customs, bring together several dozen and sometimes hundreds of people. Untraced contacts in the community, rumours and lack of information within the communities could be an important transmission lever that needs to be managed urgently.

The town is the capital of the Sool region, with four officially recognised districts, Caynaba, Las Caanood, Taleh, and Xudun, where about 480,744 households reside. 
A month ago, around 20,000 people were already reported displaced by the resurgence of clashes. 
There is an uncontrolled exodus of people out of the city seeking refuge in the surrounding area with host families or informal camps. People didn't have time to organise and pack belongings, and reports speak of people forming spontaneous settlements and sleeping under trees. Others take shelter with relatives, clansmen or friends. This often exacerbates already fragile conditions of those already experiencing drought impacts and food insecurity. 

The conflict has exacerbated the current situation caused by an ongoing drought and severe food insecurity. Already existing IDPs and others vulnerable groups following the context are again exposed to displacement, challenges, food insecurity and health risk. For many fleeing this violence, it is the second time they have had to move after arriving in the city in search of food and water.

According to the OCHA Situation report for Tigray on December 6th, the entire region is hard to reach with population's access to humanitarian assistance and services being highly restricted. The security situation in the area is still volatile. The Ethiopian RC with its regional, zonal and branches are well positioned to distribute immediate life-saving assistance to difficult to reach areas and to conduct rapid and comprehensive multi-sectoral assessment with support from the National Office, the IFRC, PNSs and ICRC. 
 
While access constraints have previously limited detailed assessments, current information indicates that approximately 5.4 million people in Tigray are in need of humanitarian assistance. According to WFP Emergency Food Security Assessment in August 2022, Food insecurity in Tigray increased by six percentage points between November 2021 and June 2022. 89 percent of the surveyed households are classified as food insecure and 47 % are severely food insecure. Furthermore, over 75 % of the households reported that they do not have access to markets and 85 percent reported that they do not use markets due to lack of cash to purchase food, the report states."

The coasts of the Mono, Ouémé and Niger rivers in Benin experienced a peak in river overflow. This situation has led to widespread flooding in several municipalities in Benin such as: Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Sô-Ava, Sèmè-Podji, Aguégués, Adjohoun, Bonou, Dangbo, Ouinhi, Zagnanado, Zogbodomey, Glazoué, Grand-Popo, Athiémé, Lokossa, Bopa, Tchaourou, Malanville, Karimama, Banikoara, Dassa-Zoumè, Savalou, and Zè, with several villages currently under water.

As a result of this session, a series of feasible recommendations were agreed upon with partners and members to reduce exposure to flooding and assist affected families, including rapid assessment of the situation followed by actions to relocate communities affected by flooding and in dire need of immediate assistance. This situation has placed these areas on red alert and according to forecasts by the Meteorological Service, these areas could remain on red alert until November due to the continued intensification of rainfall until this period. Several meetings have been organized since September 29 at the local level where the Red Cross is present through its decentralized structures. It should be noted that some communes, including Zangnanado, one of the most vulnerable communes in Benin in terms of flooding, did not wait for the heavy rains before formulating a request for support to the Beninese Red Cross. In addition, seeing dangerously the rise of the rains with the damage that characterizes them, from September 30, the municipalities have addressed by formulating requests to the National Society to support the relocation in safe areas, families affected by floods and provide them with immediate assistance through a range of services including shelter, health services and basic needs, as well as ensure the prevention of diseases.

Regular observation of the volcano's activities has been initiated by the observatory with regular reports of continued seismic activity. Considering this worrying information transmitted by the Karthala observatory and according to the National Emergency Plan related to Karthala's activities in the country, the Minister of Interior in charge of security launched the yellow alert on 17 August 2022. The country was thus entering the phase of volcanic vigilance. 

On 22 August, the Directorate of Civil Security convened the first information meeting of all risk and disaster management actors, including the Comoros Red Crescent, to discuss the immediate actions to be taken following the alert.

In the Fixed Command Post meeting on 5 September, the Karthala Volcano Observatory showed that the evolution of the volcano is worrying as the seismic movements have decreased and the magma pockets have gone from 12km deep to 1.5km and insisted on vigilance as the magma can move quickly to the surface which can surprise everyone if there is no preparation now. The KVO experts have shown that the reaction of the Karthala volcano can be unpredictable. According to their analysis, this means that there is very little control and certainty over whether the orange or red phase is triggered. This level of volcanic alert may therefore last for days, or weeks or even a year but can also return to a normal situation. The nature of the eruption is not known in advance, but several risks are already identified by the KVO based on current observations and historical data"

The food security and livelihoods of 5,000 families (28,650 people) have been severely compromised by limited water and pasture.

In 2017, 408 suspected measles cases reported with 122 confirmed. The following prefectures are affected:  Nzérékoré, Gueckedou, Matoto, Ratoma, Fria, Dubreka, Kindia, Coyah, Kaloum, Dixinn, Forécariah and Matam. The Prefectures of Siguiri, Labé and Boké are on alert. 

In this particular situation and in compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR), the government, through the Ministry of Health has declared measles outbreak in those prefectures on February 08th, 2017. It also seeks support from technical and financial partners to rapidly eradicate the measles before the months of execessive heat which leads to the rapid spread of measles."

In parts of Kilifi, Garissa, Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok and Marsabit there are now significant shortages of pasture and water, and in some cases livestock mortality. The food insecurity situation is exacerbated by conflict in some counties, the most serious case in the previous month (September) being along the borders of Isiolo and Garissa where pastoralists' convergence is common.
The prospects for the coming months will be determined by the onset and performance of the short rains season. If the season is below average, as currently forecast, or its onset is late, then the drought situation will become significantly worse, with impacts on health and nutrition, household purchasing power, and security.

In the town of Garissa (North Eastern Province) on 2 April a siege by suspected al Shabaab Islamist militants at the city's Garissa University College Campus took place. Reports indicate that several gunmen opened fire on guards at around 05h30 before being confronted by police and withdrawing into the campus buildings with several hostages. 
?	At 22h00 2 April, official and local sources have confirmed that the siege is over. 
?	As of now, at least 152 people have been confirmed dead, although it is likely the number will be much higher. At least 79 people are reported injured. Victims are being transferred to Garissa General Hospital. However, due to the high number of injured, some of them have been referred to private hospitals.
?	Kenya's Interior Minister told reporters in Garissa that about 500 out of 815 students were accounted for.
?	All 4 attackers (who reportedly had explosives strapped to them) are reported to have been killed. 
?	The affected area has been cordoned off by the security forces. A 18h30-06h30 curfew in Garissa, Mandera, Wajir and Tana River is to be implemented from 3 April to 14 April."

To date, an estimated 106,000 people have been displaced, 48 killed, and 19 remain missing. The floods have also caused extensive damage to crops, livestock and infrastructure. The southern districts of Nsanje, Chikwawa, Phalombe and Zomba are the most affected. A growing concern is disease prevention, given the poor sanitary and drainage conditions at relocation sites.

In response, the President of the Republic of Malawi declared a State of Disaster in the 15 affected districts (out of a total of 28 districts) on 13 January 2015. With the numbers of people affected and displaced continuing to rise, the President has appealed to the international community for support, specifically in the provision of tents, food and non-food items; and in the conducting of search and rescue operations. Some areas are inaccessible,
impeding the conducting of assessments.

While a decrease in rainfall is forecasted for southern Malawi over the next week, more rains are predicted for the north of the country. Malawi has been receiving significant rains since December 2014, and this trend is expected to continue as the country is forecasted to receive normal to above-normal rainfall between January and March 2015."

In order to avoid the spread of the disease into its territory, the Chadian government has stopped all the aerial traffic with Nigeria. However, the border the two countries share remains uncontrolled, with people moving in and out on a daily basis. The armed conflict in the northern part of Nigeria has resulted into population movement in the region of Lac.

It is the first time in history that Chad prepares for Ebola. Its population, as well as the health institutions, have no knowledge of the mode of transmission, measurement and prevention. The Ministry of Health has initiated some measures to prevent the occurrence of the disease and to prepare the response to this epidemic through:

-	Strengthening the epidemiological surveillance in the border areas with Nigeria
-	Putting in place health check point  at the airport and in border control check point
-	Installation of tents to isolate affected persons."

This is a 32% increase compared with the immediate previous year. A total of 319,244 metric tonnes will be required to cover the cereal deficit that the country is facing. 

The figures documented by the ZIMVAC assessment are primarily rural households and do not include the urban households. As has become a trend in food insecurity, the severely affected provinces in terms of percentage of food insecure population are; Matebeleland North (40%), Matebeleland South (32%), Masvingo (32%) and Midlands (30%). Post-harvest losses account to 20-30% of grain losses. Below is a table highlighting the most affected provinces and districts.

Late onset of rainfall, pro-longed dry spells and erratic rainfall coupled with limited access to inputs account for the poor performance of the 2012/13 agricultural season. The ZIMVAC report also notes that levels of child severe acute malnutrition exceed the globally accepted rates (4.7% compared to  the global rate of 2%).  Zimbabwe Red Cross has decided to target Gwanda district which has a population of 112,267.
