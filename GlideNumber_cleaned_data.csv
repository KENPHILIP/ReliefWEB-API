CE-2023-000066-SDN,https://glidenumber.net/glide/public/search/details.jsp?glide=22846&record=51&last=1985,Complex Emergency,Sudan,"In the early morning of Saturday, 15 April 2023, Khartoum woke up to the sound of gunfire and explosions. This was the first time that the capital city of Sudan, home to 6 million people, was at the epicentre of a fierce conflict between two powerful groups, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). 

Clashes broke out in different areas of the country and the relentless urban conflict has now taken at least 459  lives, many of them civilians, and injured over 5,000 people. 

Millions of civilians caught in the crossfire have been in lockdown for nearly two weeks, and many have run out of basic supplies like food, water, and medicine, having instead to borrow them or take the risk of fleeing through extremely dangerous routes. 

The conflict has also taken a significant toll on public infrastructure, with the destruction of hospitals and health facilities, leaving only 16 percent  of these facilities operating regularly in Khartoum. Residential buildings, water infrastructure, and energy infrastructure have been damaged as well, with continued disruption of service, while communications and internet connectivity have also been compromised. Both private and public facilities have been ransacked, and some burnt down, including on the premises of SRCS.  

The latest ceasefire has partially held, allowing evacuations to take place and some families to restock. However, food and water shortages, and lack of fuel, are leading to sharp increases in the cost of these basic commodities, while the price of transportation out of conflict areas is unaffordable for many. Families are prioritising the evacuation of women and children, who are exposed to heightened risks including sexual and gender-based violence, as reported by women-led organisations in Sudan . 

After 15 days of uninterrupted fighting, the full extent of the humanitarian situation is yet to be determined, but to date this conflict has put at least 9 million Sudanese, chiefly those living near the clashes, under severe hardship, unable to access emergency healthcare or medicines for those suffering from chronic conditions. The health facilities that remain functional lack staff and equipment, and the available blood is at risk due to power cuts in the cold chain. Women who are about to give birth cannot access ante-natal care and may be at risk of delivering without medical supervision. Lack of access to potable water is also leading people to seek water from the Nile, which could lead to a spike in diarrhoeal diseases, and will have repercussions on the nutrition status of children and pregnant and lactating women. 

Widespread displacement is ongoing, mainly in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur. There are chaotic scenes in Port Sudan and Wadi Halfa bordering Egypt, with people stranded for several days at a time attempting to leave the country. Displacement has also affected refugees living in Sudan, with many sheltering in crowded camps in White Nile State, Gedaref, and Kassala. People are also fleeing to neighbouring countries, including Chad, Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Central African Republic (CAR)."

There is an uncontrolled exodus of people out of the city seeking refuge in the surrounding area with host families or informal camps. People didn't have time to organise and pack belongings, and reports speak of people forming spontaneous settlements and sleeping under trees. Others take shelter with relatives, clansmen or friends. This often exacerbates already fragile conditions of those already experiencing drought impacts and food insecurity. 

The conflict has exacerbated the current situation caused by an ongoing drought and severe food insecurity. Already existing IDPs and others vulnerable groups following the context are again exposed to displacement, challenges, food insecurity and health risk.

goldmine, located in the Kakasi forest reserve, Kamwenge district, western Uganda. Reports from the Ministry indicate that two cases, with one death, were reported on 14 July 2007. The second case is under treatment and close monitoring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis on 30 July 2007. There is fear of at least 47 suspected cases in Kampala as a result of secondary transmission/contact from the first infected person who traveled to Kampala where he was being treated before his death. There are further fears of the potential spread of the disease in Kayunga district since some gold miners from Kitaka traveled back to their homes in Kayunga. This scenario puts the neighbouring districts of Mbarara, Kabarole and Mukono at high risk."

Baringo County has over the years been faced with skirmishes involving bandits believed to be from the communities of Pokot and their neighbours namely Turkana, Marakwet, Ilchamus and the Tugen communities. The cause of these unrest and conflicts has always been blamed on animal thefts, raids and counter attacks and often considered as resource-based conflict caused by limited resources such as pasture and water points. The current conflicts are more sporadic, widespread and concentrated at the border areas between these communities. In some cases, the attacks seem like planned revenge from previous cattle thefts but the actual cause has been difficult to determine with some unverified information form the Turkana community (Tugen and Ilchamus) suggesting that the Pokot intend to expand their boundary into Turkana land. 

The current conflict begun with an attack on Pokot community by armed people believed to be from Turkana at a water point near Kapedo bridge on 11th January 2021 resulting in injuries which were managed through KRCS branch level response. Another retaliatory attack occurred on 13th January 2021, followed by more counter- revenge attacks from both communities destroying properties, killing animals, and burning down houses and killing some people. By 17th January 2021, a total of 14 houses had been torched, 1 person killed including a security police officer and several others injured indicating the situation was worsening and deteriorating into a humanitarian crisis. 

On 18th January 2021, the Government deployed full security operation in the area resulting in an uncontrolled and widespread escalation of conflict, with many injuries and displacement of locals fleeing away from the conflict areas.

There are indications that the situation is likely to worsen further by January 2017. During the long rains season between March and May 2016, there was heavy flooding of River Tana, which washed away crops and delayed planting amongst the communities living along the river in Garissa and Tana River, resulting in reduced household level food security and dietary intake. Farming communities in marginal agricultural areas continue to have typically low income due to the recent below average agricultural season. As the lean season progresses these communities will continue to rely on the markets for food access. Short rains are the primary production season in these areas, it is expected that poor performance is likely to exacerbate household acute food insecurity with more households moving to even crisis levels."

Areas in the south-east and the coast are the most affected since they received below-average rainfall during the long rains season. One county (Kilifi) is in the alarm drought phase, while all others are in alert or normal, with a generally worsening trend.
In parts of Kilifi, Garissa, Lamu, Kwale, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Makueni, Kajiado, Narok and Marsabit there are now significant shortages of pasture and water, and in some cases livestock mortality. The food insecurity situation is exacerbated by conflict in some counties, the most serious case in the previous month (September) being along the borders of Isiolo and Garissa where pastoralists' convergence is common.
The prospects for the coming months will be determined by the onset and performance of the short rains season. If the season is below average, as currently forecast, or its onset is late, then the drought situation will become significantly worse, with impacts on health and nutrition, household purchasing power, and security. The implications of a poor season are particularly worrying for the marginal agricultural counties which are short rains-dependent.
