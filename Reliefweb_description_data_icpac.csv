Rural populations in Ali Sabieh, Arta, Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil are particularly exposed to extreme deprivation and no longer able to cope due to lack of access to main basic services as water, health, and education. Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. ([ECHO, 7 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3854203))

IPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3).

Current IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3862372))

According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285 000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July‑December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one‑quarter of the country’s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis.The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.([FAO, 07 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3986886))

In Djibouti city alone, initial estimates indicate that over 30,000-40,000 families (150,000-250,000 people) have been somewhat affected by the floods, and 9 people (7 children) have reportedly been killed. Reports indicate that between 21 and 24 November, almost 300mm of rain were recorded in Djibouti city alone, or over three times the annual average. Dwellings, shops, schools and infrastructure have been damaged. In some neighborhoods, access to electricity was also interrupted. In other areas of the country, damages to roads and flash floods have affected access to several communities, and information available to date indicate that at least 300 families are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in Tadjourah region alone. The recently inaugurated Tadjourah-Balho road, and road between Djibouti and Tadjourah suffered severe damages. A bridge in Arta area (PK53) is in danger of collapsing. ([UNCT Djibouti/Gov't of Djibouti, 24 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3409423))


 Some 250,000 people have been affected countrywide (26% of the population), and 150,000 (including migrants and refugees) are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. In Djibouti city alone, 200,000 were affected (21% of the total population) and 120,000 require immediate relief support. Some 10 people (7 children) have reportedly been killed. Floods also caused widespread destruction of infrastructure, homes and livelihoods. ([UNCT Djibouti/Gov't of Djibouti, 05 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3426433))


Heavy rains fell between 21 and 28 November 2019 with a peak between 22 and 23 November in Djibouti. The equivalent of two years of precipitation occurred in one day. New rains between 7 and 10 December made access to the affected areas more difficult. 11 people (including 7 children) lost their lives due to flooding and a landslide due to heavy rainfall.

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

On 25 September 2022, a total of 16 new cholera cases (14 severe) were reported. There were no new deaths. While 2 patients were discharged, Cholera Treatment Centers (CTC) reported 14 new admissions. Anecdotally, the outbreak is also reported to have expanded to the Dolo Mena woreda, which constitutes a risk of further spread. Cholera outbreak response activities are ongoing in both woredas.

As of 10 October, 191 cholera cases were reported in 3 woredas of Bale zone (Harana Buluk, Berbere and Delo Mena) with 4 associated deaths (Cumulative Case Fatality Rate – CFR - of 2.09 per cent1). The use of unsafe water from contaminated water points is the most likely cause of this outbreak. Limited access to water and sanitation (WASH) services, poor hygiene practices, including open defecation and lack of water treatment options are among the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease across these three woredas. New suspected cases are reported daily in the three affected woredas. As of the reporting date, there are 15 active cases (3 cases in Delo Mena, 10 in Berbere and 2 in Harana Buluk woredas) in the existing Cholera Treatment Center (CTC), with 71 per cent of the patients experiencing severe dehydration symptoms.

On 24 April, flash floods killed four persons and damaged 53 houses (fully) and 212 houses (partially) in Dire Dawa; on 25 April, river overflow damaged social infrastructure and affected livestock in Jinka town, SNNP; and on 25/26 April, flash floods affected 34,507 households and displaced 15,195 households in Erer, Sitti, Nogob and Korahe zones, Somali region.
Local communities in the Dawa zone that spoke to humanitarian partners, stated that they have never experienced such amount of water in the Dawa River. On May 4, the flood caused a total collapse of the main bridges between Hudet to Negalle and Mubarak to Filtu. In addition to this, the rains made travel to rural areas within the Dawa zone difficult. ([OCHA, 6 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3632191))

During the months of April and May 2020, heavy and prolonged belg/gu rains led to flooding and landslide incidents in Somali, Oromia, Afar, SNNP and Dire Dawa. Latest National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) reports indicate that close to 470,163 people are affected and 301,284 people are displaced by floods across the country. ([OCHA, 22 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3637479))

Overall, at least 151,828 people were affected by recent floods (July and August), including 100,176 people displaced as of mid-August, including 40,731 people displaced in Afar, 20,868 people displaced in Somali, 1,125 people displaced in Oromia (excluding the 141 people displaced by landslide in East Wollega zone), 25,703 people displaced in SNNP and 11,749 people displaced in Gambella. ([OCHA, 18 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3662834))

Heavy summer season (June – September) rains continue to cause flooding in many parts of the country. Some 500,000 people were so far affected, including some 300,000 displaced. Most recently, on 1 September, Awash River broke its embankment and flooded downstream areas in Amibara and Awash Fentale woredas of Afar region. ([OCHA, 7 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668160))

In Ethiopia, nearly 1.1 million people have been affected by floods, including over 313,000 people displaced, with Afar, Amhara, Gambella, Oromia, Somali and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's (SNNP) regions most-affected. Across these regions, more than 1.1 million people were displaced by violence before the floods hit. ([OCHA, 23 Oct 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3681617))

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from **Uganda**. It is also known to be present in **Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda**. The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties [in **Kenya**]. [FAO] and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. ([OCHA, UNCT Kenya, 23 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2041984))

In collaboration with [FAO] and other development partners, the Government of **Ethiopia** has intensified efforts to protect major maize growing areas from the ravage of the fall armyworm. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52 962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states – Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR)...The Government of Ethiopia allocated nearly USD 2 million to tackle the problem. ([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In **Kenya**, the pest has so far affected about 200 000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected. ([FAO, 14 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2122994))

An outbreak of fall armyworm was reported by the Government of **South Sudan** in the Equatoria region including Magwi, Yei and Juba, Northern Bahr el Gazal and parts of Jonglei area. ([FAO, 18 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2128589))

Despite containment efforts, fall armyworm (FAW) - an insect native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas—is expected to remain a threat to food insecurity in the **Horn of Africa** in 2018. ([OCHA, 29 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2436729))

**South Sudan**'s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) developed a five-year plan for sustainable management and control of Fall Armyworm in the country.  ([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. ([FEWSNET, 28 Feb 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3016143))

FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in **Ethiopia**. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3276678))

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

In 2018, **Ethiopia's** Ministry of Agriculture and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the FAW caused an estimated 35% reduction in crop yields in Meher seasonal production, affecting more than 150,000 out of 770,000 hectares infested across the country. ([IPC, 20 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3403688))

An outbreak of Fall Armyworm was recently signaled in **Burundi**, but, significant impacts on crop production are not expected due to the availability of pesticides and improved knowledge of control practices among farmers.

In week 15 (week ending 16 April 2017), a total of 2,388 suspected cases of AWD/cholera were reported in Afar, Amhara and Somali regions of the country. While some decline has been observed in the trend in the last weeks [4,200 cases in week 14; 4,104 cases in week 13; 4,358 cases in week 12], it is still premature to deduce overall improvement in the situation on the ground, especially with the weak surveillance system. Somali region remains the most affected, accounting for 99% of the new cases reported in the reporting week. On 20 April 2017, WHO elevated the outbreak of AWD/cholera and the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia to grade 3 emergency. This new grading enables the organization to leverage its global capacity and scale up the response to the outbreak and the humanitarian crisis.

Eighty-eight percent of the cases and 94% of the deaths were reported in Somali Region alone. ([WHO, 17 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2126064))

A 27 per cent increase in the number of [AWD] cases was reported nationwide last week, mainly due to spikes in new cases reported in Amhara and Tigray regions and a resurgence of the outbreak in Afar region where community transmission of the disease is widespread. Currently, the major risk factors for the spread of the outbreak are holy water sites where large numbers of Christian pilgrims congregate from around the country, especially in Amhara and Tigray, and seasonal mobility of daily laborers to commercial farms. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements. ([OCHA, 03 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2200974))

[AWD] cases continue to be reported from Afar, Amhara, Tigray and Oromia regions mainly from religious sites and commercial farms that have poor sanitation facilities and limited access to clean water. Somali region also continues to report AWD cases although at a reduced rate.

Central zone and Mekelle have the majority of cases but now it is shifting to Western zone. This week there were 64 patients of which 43 per cent are from Western zone, 35 per cent in Mekelle. Risk factors are mainly due to untreated water consumption which accounts to 70 per cent of the total factors. Government and partners are distributing water treatment chemicals and health supplies, but needs surpass resources being availed. High operational cost for response, low involvement of sectors and low level of response by most partners are among the critical challenges to AWD response in the region.

As a result, some 5.6 million people in Ethiopia require emergency food assistance in 2017. In addition, 2.7 million children and pregnant and lactating mothers require supplementary feeding, 9.2 million people need support to access safe drinking water, 1.9 million households need livestock support, and 300,000 children between 6-59 months old are targeted for the treatment for severe acute malnutrition in 2017. Drought conditions are expected to peak during the dry December to March jilaal season, which is likely to lead to a sharper deterioration in livestock body conditions, and impacting milk production and nutrition status of the families that depend on livestock for their food and income.

Southern and eastern Ethiopia continue to battle the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought, exacerbated by disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihood assets and displacement. The humanitarian situation countrywide has been further compounded by below average spring rains – the third consecutive poor/failed rains in the southern drought belt. [...] In the second half of 2017, some 8.5 million people will require emergency food assistance, some 3.6 million children and pregnant and lactating mothers will require supplementary feeding, some 10.5 million people will not have regular access to safe drinking water and some 2.25 million households will require livestock support.

Since the revision of the Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) in August 2017, the humanitarian context in Ethiopia has continued to evolve which has led the Government and humanitarian partners to further adjust the HRD requirements. In the food sector the needs have been revised slightly upwards to accommodate an increase in the number of beneficiaries through the inclusion of 4 million former Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) clients in the HRD. In other sectors such as health and nutrition, needs have also continued to increase mainly due to the deteriorating nutrition situation in Somali region, increase in the number of displaced people, as well as the Fall Army Worm (FAW) outbreak that continues to ravage crops throughout the country.

The meher assessment findings revealed that two previous years of consecutive drought, compounded with weak rains at the end of 2017 left hundreds of thousands destitute in southern and south-eastern Ethiopia. Poor pasture regeneration and limited water source replenishment for livestock have resulted in acute humanitarian needs and will reduce traditional recovery processes among pastoralist households. Consequently, the food security situation in the lowland agro-pastoral areas is not expected to improve significantly in 2018. Overall, the good harvest in highland areas, is expected to reduce large scale needs in the northern highlands, however reduced harvest and crop loss were experienced due to erratic rainfall in some potential areas. The multi-sector humanitarian response operation established over the course of 2017 will need to be sustained in 2018. The extent of needs and the corresponding humanitarian operation will be reviewed during the belg/gu/ganna assessment in June/July.

A recent FEWS NET survey in Dollo Zone of Somali Region suggests food security and nutrition outcomes have improved significantly in areas worst affected by drought in 2016 and 2017. These improvements are largely due to improvements in seasonal performance, continued humanitarian assistance delivery, and declines in disease outbreaks. Currently, worst affected areas such as Dollo Zone and much of southeastern Somali Region are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), with humanitarian assistance preventing a further deterioration among some populations, particularly IDPs. While the risk of a deterioration beyond Emergency (IPC Phase 4) has declined, continued humanitarian assistance is needed through at least September... The 2018 Belg (March to May) rains performed very poorly over most northern Belg-producing areas, leading harvests to be as much as 40 percent below average and delayed by one to two months. ([FEWSNET, 12 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2693599))

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are projected to persist through at least January 2019 across large areas of Somali Region, as drought recovery continues amidst recent conflicts. In addition, ethnic conflicts in Oromia along the Somali border and between West Guji of Oromia and Gedeo of SNNPR have caused significant displacement, restricting typical access to food and income sources. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2!) outcomes, only in the presence of humanitarian assistance, are projected to continue. ([FEWSNET, 31 Aug 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2768249))

Prevailing dry conditions across the region have led to the deterioration of farmland and pastures, loss of livestock, sharply increased food prices, and reduction of the availability of water in large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. At the regional level, the number of severely food insecure people has increased to approximately 12 million, in large part as a result of the drought. Pre-existing protection, health, WASH, and shelter needs have been also been exacerbated. The humanitarian needs of the region’s growing displaced population are of particular concern. ([ACAPS, 22 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3224738/))

The Government of Ethiopia has released for the first time an Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis report in the country up to June 2020 during the Disaster Risk Management Technical Working Group (DRM TWG) meeting on 19 November 2019 ... The IPC Alert on Ethiopia states that food security will slightly improve until January 2020 due to the seasonal (meher/summer) harvest, but this will be offset by below-normal belg season production, conflict and climate-induced displacement, high food prices, and the long dry spell in northeastern pastoralist areas, which will likely result in about 6.7 million people being in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse, and requiring humanitarian assistance. The Alert projects the number of food-insecure people in Crisis or worse to increase to 8.5 million between February and June 2020 given that the meher harvest is insufficient to support food consumption through the lean season in belg-dependent and pastoralist areas, and food prices are expected to be higher than in previous years. ([OCHA, 01 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3420413))

The food security situation is deteriorating in lowlands of Wag Hamra, North Gonder, Central Gonder and North Wollo zones of Amhara region due to crop failure and reduction of income from sale of livestock and livestock products. So far, the regional Government has provided
emergency food aid for drought-affected people in Wag Hamra zone. However, droughtaffected people in North Gonder (Janamora), Central Gonder (East Belessa) and North Wollo (Kobo, Gubalafto and Habru) zones have not yet received food assistance. The regional Government requested partners to support in non-food sectors, mainly WaSH, education, agriculture and livestock and livelihood, including cash assistance. ([OCHA, 05 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3463913))

Some seven million people need humanitarian aid including emergency food assistance, according to the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC). Global climate change has brought detrimental impact on Ethiopia and resulted recurrent drought. The government has been exerting maximum efforts to prevent the drought and El Niño induced impact jointly with international donors. ([Gov't, Ethiopia, 26 Jan 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3493818/))

Much of the eastern part of the country is expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Stressed (IPC Phase 2) from February to September. Humanitarian assistance is expected to improve outcomes in some areas to Stressed! (IPC Phase 2!) and Minimal! (IPC Phase 1!). ([FEWS NET, WFP, 07 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3554258/))

High food assistance needs are likely to persist in Ethiopia due to the compounding impacts of COVID-19 related restrictions, insecurity, weather shocks including forecast below-average October to December rains, the poor macroeconomic context, and dessert locusts. In much of the eastern and central parts of the country, though economic activity has slowly increased, households still face limited ability to access income. This coupled with the increasing food prices and atypical flooding is leading to many households facing difficulty meeting their food and non-food needs. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are anticipated to persist through much of the projection period. ([FEWS NET, 10 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3669370/))

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in many parts of Tigray as households are expected to continue to have limited ability to access food and income. In the absence of humanitarian assistance, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are likely ongoing in some central and eastern areas of Tigray; however, as economic activity is expected to improve as the conflict remains at lower levels, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to emerge in February/March 2021. Below-average October to December hagaya/deyr rainfall across southeastern pastoral areas has driven below-normal pasture and water availability for this time of year, resulting in a decline in milk production. The likely below-average February to May 2021 rainfall is likely to negatively impact belg production in most of SNNPR, central and eastern Oromia, eastern Amhara, and southern Tigray. In addition to the below-average rainfall, the likely below-average area planted is expected to drive a below-average harvest, which will likely negatively impact food availability from June onward. Furthermore, the forecasted below-average gu in southern and southeastern pastoral areas and sugum in northern pastoral areas are expected to drive pasture and water availability deterioration. ([FEWS NET, 31 Dec 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3701346/))

It is projected that 12.9 million people face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) from January to June 2021, despite humanitarian food assistance, including about 2.6 million in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). These projections do not include any food security and livelihoods impacts caused by recent fighting in Tigray, which means the number of people in crisis or worse may be even higher. ([FAO WFP , 23 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3723687/))

An IPC analysis update conducted in Tigray and the neighbouring zones of Amhara and Afar concludes that over 350,000 people are in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) between May and June 2021. This is the highest number of people in IPC Phase 5 since the 2011 famine in Somalia. This severe crisis results from the cascading effects of conflict, including population displacements, movement restrictions, limited humanitarian access, loss of harvest and livelihood assets, and dysfunctional or non-existent markets. As of May 2021, 5.5 million people (61% of the people in the area) are facing high levels of acute food insecurity: 3.1 million people are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and 2.1 million people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). This is despite the major humanitarian food assistance that has reached up to 5 million people in the last few months. In the areas where data was sufficient to conduct a projection analysis, the situation is expected to worsen through September 2021, with 4.4 million people (74% of the population analysed) in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above). Among these, an estimated 400,000 people are expected to face Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). These estimations take into account an expansion of humanitarian assistance to reach 60% of the population. If the conflict further escalates or, for any other reason, humanitarian assistance is hampered, most areas of Tigray will be at Risk of Famine. ([IPC, 10 June 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3746208/))

The Tigray region of Ethiopia continues to experience one of the worst food security emergencies globally. Urgent humanitarian assistance is needed to save lives. Extreme outcomes are likely through at least January 2022 across the region, with Central, Northwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern Tigray of highest concern. Ultimately, an end to hostilities and unhindered humanitarian access are needed. ([FEWS NET/WFP, 6 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3762893/))

Humanitarian assistance needs in Ethiopia in 2022 will be at record levels, nearly 40 percent higher compared to both 2021 and 2016, which followed the historic 2015 El Niño drought. Conflict-affected northern Ethiopia remains the greatest concern, where large consumption deficits in line with Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are widespread, and it is possible outcomes are worse in parts of Tigray. In southern pastoral areas, a prolonged drought, rivaling those of 2010/2011 and 2016/2017 in terms of both severity and duration, will drive widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes. Large-scale humanitarian assistance will be needed throughout much of the country in 2022, coupled with unhindered humanitarian access in northern Ethiopia, to avert the loss of lives and livelihoods. Further, a resolution to conflict in northern Ethiopia is required to address the underlying drivers of the most severe needs. ([FEWS NET, 22 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803845/))

More than 8 million people are currently affected across southern and south-eastern parts of the country, including Somali (more than 3.5 million people), Oromia (more than 3.4 million), SNNP (more than 1.1 million), and South West1 (more than 200,000 people) regions. The drought is expanding to more areas affecting an increasing number of woredas as the weather conditions evolve and further impact the drought scale and intensity. The situation is not expected to improve rapidly due to the high probability of a fourth consecutive failed rains forecasted for this year. ([OCHA, 18 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3838556/))

The drought situation is worsening in some parts of northern, southern, and southeastern Ethiopia and is expected to deteriorate further unless aid is urgently scaled up. The shortage of rain and crop failure in some northern and southeastern areas, and then heavy rains which resulted in flooding and destruction of crops in parts of the southeastern (Somali Region) and western areas of the country have also negatively impacted income sources
from livestock sales and production... Regional authorities in Amhara and Tigray have raised alarm and alerted aid agencies of the deteriorating humanitarian situation due to drought and food insecurity in 52 woredas/districts South, East, Southeast, Central, and Northwestern, and Mekelle City of Tigray, as well as of a reported 2.8 million drought and conflict-affected people in 43 districts of North and South Wello, North Shewa, Oromia Special and North Gondar zones of Amhara region. The current food insecurity poses a threat to an already dire situation as the two regions face beyondemergency thresholds. In Amhara, about one million people lack access to drinking water as at least 1,500 water points have dried up. Farmlands have been damaged and 2.4 million livestock have been affected.

The main focus of the crisis was across southern Ethiopia, south-central Somalia and northern Kenya. Regional drought came on top of successive bad rains and rising inflation. It ramped up a chronic livelihoods crisis into a tipping point of potential disaster by putting extreme pressure on food prices, livestock survival, and water and food availability. Armed conflict across the region compounded chronic ecological and economic vulnerability, which escalated the crisis and limited people’s survival and recovery choices.

As of 23 Jan, a total of 15 patients presenting fever, jaundice, muscle pain and fever pain (13 males and two females) were line-listed; and three deaths were recorded. A total of three cases turned out positive out of six samples analyzed. The majority of the cases are between 11 years-40 years (82.41 and are reported to come from Merti (bordering Wajir) and Garba Tulla (bordering Garissa) sub-counties. Unconfirmed reports later this week have indicated a possibility of new cases in Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet. The Ministry of Health reported an outbreak and issued an alert on 3 March received to all the 47 counties and initiated a response both at the County and national levels on 4 March. 

As a response, the Ministry of Health is initiating a national vaccination campaign starting with Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Samburu, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, West Pokot, Turkana, Mandera, and Tana River. Yellow fever vaccine is an effective public health prevention intervention and is offered as a scheduled routine vaccine for children aged nine months in four counties in Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot, Turkana, and Baringo). 

The first cases of **Chikungunya** were reported in mid-February 2022 in Kotulo within Wajir County.

Public health officials are warning that more cases should be expected as the seasonal ‘long rains’ run through to the end of May, boosting mosquito populations. Previous outbreak data and monthly trends show that annual upsurges are experienced after the short and long rainfall seasons with dual peaks in February and June. The usual trend is that the next peak would occur in June, after the long rains have subdued; however, in this case, the virus is surging at the beginning of the long rains, which will most likely make the situation worse as conditions become more conducive for the mass spread of the disease vector.

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

The outbreak was first detected on 2 January 2019 in Narok county followed by Kajiado County one week later. Following investigations, it was determined that the initial cases started after a communal meal and the outbreak was subsequently sustained by poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) conditions in the affected areas. Environmental samples collected by the investigational teams demonstrated that a river shared by both counties was contaminated by surface water runoff which was thought to be soiled by human waste due to widespread open defecation in the vicinity.

A cVDPV2 outbreak in the Horn of Africa has been detected in Somali province, **Ethiopia**. The virus was isolated from an AFP case with onset of paralysis on 20 May 2019. Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in **Kenya**. Currently, Somalia has reported three cVDPV2 cases in 2019. Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared this outbreak – together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia – to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response. Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa specifically between Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, as well as suboptimal subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, the Horn of Africa is considered at high-risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2.

According to media, as of 20 March, the death toll has reached at least 15 people in the provinces of Central, Nyanza and Eastern. They also reported that around 1 000 people were evacuated in the counties of Makueni (Eastern province), Kilifi and Tana (Coast province). Over the next 24 hours, more heavy rain with local thunderstorms is forecast for the affected areas. ([ECHO, 20 Mar 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2519309))

The March–May long rains began atypically early countrywide and with significantly above-average amounts, upwards of 145 percent of the long-term averages. The rains are welcomed after the extended dry season in many eastern areas of the country, improving water availability, but have also led to flooding. In Kajiado, Makueni, and Kilifi, flooding destroyed property, displaced households, and caused approximately five deaths, mostly children. ([FEWS NET, 22 Mar 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2522934))

Floods have displaced more than 211,000 people and reportedly killed 72 people and injured 33 across Kenya since March 2018. The most affected counties are Turkana, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo, Kisumu, Taita, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, West Pokot, Samburu and Narok, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS). The floods have disrupted livelihoods, with at least 8,450 acres of farmland submerged in water and more than 6,000 livestock killed, destroyed houses and damaged infrastructure, such as roads and health facilities ([OCHA, 25 Apr 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2573809))

The rainfall pattern has changed this year affecting at least 29 counties and it has been described as a mini El Nino phenomenon by the local meteorological department. According to preliminary reports, the rains have caused flooding that has left 211,155 people displaced, 72 dead and 33 injured. These numbers are likely to increase as the heavy rains are expected to continue until July. ([IFRC, 1 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2585064))

At the peak of the rains in April, flooding was causing widespread damage. By May, approximately 150 people had died and a further 310,000 had been displaced across 40 counties. Cropland and irrigation infrastructure, such as pumps and pipes, were extensively damaged. About 28 percent of the total crop in Turkana was destroyed. In  other counties the loss of cropland was as follows: 10,000 acres in Tana River, 12,355 acres in Embu, Kitui and Makueni, 200 acres in Narok, 1,507 acres in Taita Taveta, and about 4,500 acres in Kilifi. Health facilities, schools, markets and roads were destroyed, affecting access to health and education, the supply of food commodities and medical provisions, and food prices. Approximately 3,700 small stock were lost across Wajir, Tana River, Garissa and Marsabit. By late June, the flood waters had receded in most areas and normal livelihood activities such as crop production had resumed.  ([Govt. Kenya, 31 Aug 2018.](https://reliefweb.int/node/2798159))

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from **Uganda**. It is also known to be present in **Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda**. The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties [in **Kenya**]. [FAO] and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. ([OCHA, UNCT Kenya, 23 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2041984))

In collaboration with [FAO] and other development partners, the Government of **Ethiopia** has intensified efforts to protect major maize growing areas from the ravage of the fall armyworm. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52 962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states – Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR)...The Government of Ethiopia allocated nearly USD 2 million to tackle the problem. ([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In **Kenya**, the pest has so far affected about 200 000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected. ([FAO, 14 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2122994))

**South Sudan**'s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) developed a five-year plan for sustainable management and control of Fall Armyworm in the country.  ([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. ([FEWSNET, 28 Feb 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3016143))

FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in **Ethiopia**. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3276678))

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

In 2018, **Ethiopia's** Ministry of Agriculture and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the FAW caused an estimated 35% reduction in crop yields in Meher seasonal production, affecting more than 150,000 out of 770,000 hectares infested across the country. ([IPC, 20 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3403688))

After a poor performance of the long rains between March and May 2014 in the arid and semi-arid zones, the drought situation continued to affect both pastoral and marginal agriculture livelihood zones (the North Western, Northern, North Eastern, South Eastern and parts of Coast) with an impact on households’ food availability as well as livestock productivity. The situation continued to worsen due to the increase in food prices. ([IFRC, 24 Sep 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/694348))

The acutely food insecure population increased from 1.3 million in February to 1.5 million by August. Many households remained Stressed (IPC Phase2), though some households in parts of Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, Mandera, Wajir, Baringo, and West Pokot moved into Crisis (IPC Phase 3). More households were likely to move into Crisis (IPC Phase 3) by October. ([FEWS NET, 26 Aug 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/686572))

Findings of the 2015 Long Rains Assessment (LRA) indicate that about 1.1 million people are acutely food insecure and cannot meet their basic dietary requirements, hence requiring immediate food assistance for the next six months (September 2015 – February 2016). ([Govt. 11 Sep 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1168166))

Food insecurity conditions are likely to persist throughout the outlook period, especially in the northeast, northwest, and southeast pastoral areas, and coastal and southeast marginal agricultural areas. The typical recovery of rangeland and cropping conditions during the October to December period is unlikely, as the forecasted La Niña conditions are likely to lead to below-average October to December short rains. The majority of households are expected to remain Stressed (IPC Phase 2). ([FEWS NET, 01 July 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1592231))

Deterioration of food security expected to continue even after onset of the short rains. ([FEWS NET, 03 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1718746))

Food insecurity had more than doubled - from 600,000 (Aug 2015 - March 2016) to 1.25 million
people (August 2016 – Feb 2017) ([OCHA, 26 Oct 2016. Pg 27](https://reliefweb.int/node/1754136)). The drought and food security situation in the most affected counties ranged from moderate to severe. ([Govt. 27 Oct 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1756031))

On 10 February 2017, the Government declared a national drought emergency, with 23 of 47 counties affected. The number of food insecure people more than doubled – from 1.3 million to 2.7 million. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1906393))

More than 2.6 million Kenyans were severely food insecure as of 26 May 2017 — and this number was rapidly rising. High levels of malnutrition were prevalent across the arid and semi-arid lands. Three sub-counties report Global Acute Malnutrition rates of 30 per cent, double the emergency threshold. Severe drought has dried up water resources in half of Kenya’s 47 counties and an estimated 3 million people lacked access to clean water. ([OCHA, 26 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2049409))

The National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) early warning bulletin for June indicated that while the long rains had ended, many parts of the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) were still experiencing long distances between home and water sources, unusually high food prices, and worrying levels of malnutrition. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continued to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest. ([UNICEF, 19 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2093059))

Following at least two consecutive poor rainy seasons, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes were expected through early December in areas of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, and Laikipia, requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. However, an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes was expected across all pastoral areas in early 2018; however, some of the most vulnerable households were still likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([FEWS, 18 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2333659/))

Drought conditions that were expected to persist into 2018 left 3.4 million people severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water. An estimated 482,882 children required treatment for acute malnutrition, including 104,614 who were suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Eighty-eight per cent of these children were from 23 arid and semi-arid counties. Drought conditions led to declines in school attendance and school participation and rising dropout rates. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400909))

Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes were expected to persist through September in Wajir, parts of Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Garissa, Mandera, and Tana River due to various factors, including livelihood recovery from drought and/or flooding, a livestock quarantine from an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), and insecurity. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677384))

Countrywide, the historically above-average 2018 March to May long rains continued to drive food security improvements. The marginal areas were supported by available harvests and were in Minimal (IPC Phase 1). Despite significantly improved livestock productivity and above-average terms-of-trade in pastoral areas, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes were expected to persist through January 2019. ([FEWSNET, 28 Sep 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2806614))

 In marginal agricultural areas, the October to December short rains season were significantly below average and short rains crop production were expected to be 70 percent of average. However, surplus long rains production and re-planting of short rains crops by better-off households in some areas sustained high agricultural labor demand and above-average terms of trade, facilitating food access for the poor. As a result, deterioration in food security was most likely to be gradual, but Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes were anticipated to be widespread in the February to May 2019 period. ([FEWSNET, 14 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2948704/))

The dry conditions and high temperatures experienced from January to March pushed more counties into the Alarm drought stage, from one (1) in February to five (5) in March. 20 ASAL counties were reporting a worsening trend and only three (3) indicated a stable trend. Counties in the Alarm drought phase are Wajir, Mandera, Garissa, Marsabit and Turkana. ([GOV, 18 Apr 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3089448/))

As of Jun 2019, the March – May long rains season officially ended and rains were expected only in the western and central parts of Kenya through the rest of June. Due to ongoing drought and a second consecutive below-average rainfall season, the Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG) estimates that 1.6 million people are currently in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and in need of humanitarian food assistance. ([FEWSNET, 28 Jun 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3193349/)

As the dry season progressed in eastern Kenya, the food insecure population was expected to continue to rise through October 2019. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes were widespread. However, cumulative rainfall in the west and northwest was above average since May, which is driving relative improvements in livestock and crop production. ([FEWSNET, 30 Sep 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3329158/))

At the peak of the October to December short rains season, many poor households were gradually recovering from the impact of previous drought or recent flooding on their food and income sources. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes were present across central, southeastern, and coastal Kenya, while Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes persisted in several pastoral areas. ([FEWSNET, 27 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/ https://reliefweb.int/node/3414388/))

In December 2019, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes persisted due to ongoing recovery from the 2018/19 drought and the negative impact of recent floods and landslides on household food and income sources. From October to December, Kenya experienced one of the wettest short rains seasons on record, with rainfall totals ranging up to 400 percent of average. In pastoral areas, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes remained prevalent.

In marginal agricultural areas, above-average rainfall led to mixed effects on short rains crop production, which is most likely to result in a near-average harvest on aggregate in January. In many areas, area planted is above normal, cropping conditions remain favorable, and agricultural labor demand is at typical levels. However, excess soil moisture and flooding in some coastal and southeastern areas is expected to result in below-average, short-cycle legumes production and localized maize losses. In early 2020, the availability of the short rains harvest and labor income earned in the 2020 long rains season are expected to lead to Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes in some areas. However, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes will likely be sustained in areas that are currently experiencing localized crop losses. Overall, the population experiencing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes is expected to remain atypically high through May. ([FEWSNET, 29 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3458268/))

According to the Kenya Food Security Group (KFFSG) 2020 long rains assessment, widespread Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are ongoing. Although desert locusts and floods caused crop and livestock losses, the above-average March-May long rains led to favorable harvests in most marginal agricultural areas as well as above-average livestock sale values and average milk productivity, resulting in a decline in the population in need relative to the preceding 2019 short rains assessment. FEWS NET similarly anticipates widespread area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, but Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in the Tana Riverine and Mandera Riverine Livelihood zones.  ([FEWSNET, 8 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668594/))

In the pastoral areas, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes through the scenario period will persist with the worst affected households likely in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) due to below-average herd sizes, limited assets, low income-earning opportunities, and constrained livelihood activities impacting market access. The forecast below-average 2020 short rains and 2021 long rains are expected to lead to short-lived pasture and water regeneration, and gradual declines in livestock body conditions and production, limiting household access to food and income. ([FEWSNET, 6 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3685593/))

In the marginal areas, crop production is ongoing and providing below average casual labor income opportunities. Crop conditions are good, with maize mostly at the knee-high stage with pulses and potatoes at the flowering stage. Household food stocks are dwindling, and households are mostly dependent on market food purchases and facing Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes. In the pastoral areas, goat prices are above the five-year averages and supporting household food access. However, milk production is below average, and livestock have begun migrating to dry season grazing areas within the counties. This is reducing household food consumption, increasing malnutrition, and driving Stressed (IPC Phase2) outcomes. ([FEWSNET, 31 Dec 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3701351/))

According to CHIRPS satellite rainfall estimates, the March to May long rains have been significantly below average through April. Cumulative rainfall has been less than 55 to 70 percent of normal across much of Kenya. However, localized areas in western and northeastern Kenya have received 95-145 percent of normal rainfall. In the marginal agricultural areas, the poor rainfall is affecting agricultural production, with no germination being reported in parts of Kitui and Meru North. Due to declining household food stocks and below-average casual waged labor opportunities, poor marginal agricultural households are likely Stressed (IPC Phase 2). In pastoral areas, household income and food access are increasingly constrained due to atypical livestock migration, increased insecurity from resource-based conflict and terrorism, reduced milk production and consumption, reducing livestock sale values, and high staple food prices, driving Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. ([FEWSNET, 30 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3734776/))

The cumulative impact of two consecutive poor rainy seasons, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, insecurity, pests and diseases have caused humanitarian needs to rapidly rise in the Arid and Semi-Arad Lands (ASAL) region of Kenya, leading to the declaration of a national disaster by the President of Kenya on 8 September 2021. There are now at least 2.1 million people who are severely food insecure and adopting irreversible coping strategies to meet their minimum food needs, and this is expected to rise to nearly 2.4 million people from November 2021, according to the latest Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) analysis. This will include an estimated 368,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and 2 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), and is nearly three times (852,000) the number of people who were facing high acute food insecurity from October to December 2020. Nine counties are expected to have the highest numbers of people in IPC Phase 3 and above from November 2021 onwards: Turkana, Mandera, Lamu, Garissa, Wajir, Kwale, Kitui, Tana River and Isiolo. Food insecurity is expected to worsen in the period ahead based on the likelihood of poor rains during the upcoming short rains season (October to December). ([OCHA, 30 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3778693/))

The October to December 2021 short rains have largely failed, marking the third consecutive below-average season across pastoral and marginal agricultural areas of eastern and northern Kenya. In pastoral areas, very low pasture and water resources have driven atypical livestock migration, rapid declines in livestock health and productivity, and excess livestock deaths. The drought also follows the temporary closure of livestock markets in early 2020 due to COVID-19, which already suppressed formal livestock trade in the short-term. In marginal agricultural areas, rainfall totals have been inadequate for crop development. While the distribution of food assistance, expansion of the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP), and the delivery of water and livestock feed are helping to prevent more severe food insecurity, widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes persist, with worst-affected households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). With the elevated likelihood of a fourth consecutive below-average season during the March to May 2022 long rains, there is high concern that food insecurity will increase in severity and scale in 2022, and FEWS NET expects 3-4 million people will be in need of humanitarian food assistance in Kenya. Large-scale humanitarian assistance and livelihoods support are urgently required to cover current needs in northern and eastern Kenya, and assistance should be sustained throughout 2022.([FEWSNET, 20 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3802558/))

Following a significant deterioration from the previous analysis, an estimated 3.1 million people (20% of the population in Kenya’s ASALs region) were classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above acute food insecurity in February 2022. Compared to the same period in 2021, there was an increase from 1.4 million to 3.1 million of people classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). The deterioration of food insecurity is attributed to multiple shocks, including dry spells from three consecutive poor seasonal rainfall performances (all below the five-year average), below average crop and livestock production, localized resource-based conflict, and the ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increasing staple food prices across the country. The following seven counties were the most affected, representing more than 50% of the total population classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above: Marsabit (50%), Turkana (40%), Baringo (35%), Wajir (35%), Mandera (35%), Samburu (35%) and Isiolo (30%). These areas are predominantly pastoral livelihoods. ([IPC, 31 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3833088/))

This IPC projection update for Kenya’s Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) region, covering the March to June period, was triggered by several cumulative factors. Firstly, the expected March-April-May seasonal rainfall amount received across most livelihood zones was below the long-term seasonal averages and exacerbated by poor spatial distribution. This negatively affected rangeland and also sparked resource-based conflicts. These resource-based conflicts are coupled with rising food commodity prices due to depressed crop production that coincides with the peak lean season for most Arid and Semi-Arid Livelihood counties. Overall, these factors indicate an increase in the number of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity to 4.1 million, over the 3.5 million initially projected over the same period. This includes 1.1 million in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and 3 million in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). ([IPC, 10 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3855447/))

According to the most recent analysis, from July to September 2022 (lean season), about 3.5 million people (24% of the ASAL population) are facing high levels of acute food insecurity – IPC Phase 3 or above, with about 2.7 million people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 785,000 people in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). This is a 10% increase from the same period in 2021 where 2.1 million people were categorized in IPC Phase 3 and IPC Phase 4. The food insecurity is primarily driven by a combination of shocks, including a fourth successive below average rainy season which was poorly distributed in space and short-lived which resulted in below average crop production to near crop failure and poor livestock production; localised resource-based conflict; and high food prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and low in-country production. The most affected counties, representing 40% of the total country population in IPC Phase 3 or above are: Isiolo (50%), Turkana (50%), Garissa (45%), Mandera (45%), Marsabit (45%), Samburu (45%), Wajir (45%) and Baringo (40%). These are predominantly pastoral livelihoods. ([IPC, 28 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3890705/))


In the current period, it is estimated that around 4.4 million people (27% of the ASAL population) are facing high levels of Acute Food Insecurity – IPC AFI Phase 3 (Crisis) or above, of which about 774,000 people are in IPC AFI Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared to the same period last year, this represents a 43% increase in population in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above, while compared to the previous analysis period (October-December 2022), the prevalence of
population in IPC AFI Phase 3 (Crisis) or above is similar – with a reduction of the population in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Yet, in the projected period, March – June 2023, the severity of food insecurity is expected to worsen again: about 5.4 million people (32% of the population analysed) are projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC AFI Phase 3 or above), of which 1.2 million people (7%) will likely be in Emergency (IPC AFI Phase 4). This latest projection represents the highest magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity in the ASAL areas in years: urgent action is required to reduce food gaps, protect their livelihoods, and prevent and treat acute malnutrition. ([IPC, 20 Feb 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3935420/))

Between July and September 2023, coinciding with the Agropastoral harvest and pastoral lean season, about 2.8 million people in Kenya’s Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) are classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse). Among them 2.3 million are experiencing Crisis, IPC Phase 3, and nearly 500,000 are in IPC Phase 4, Emergency. Compared to the situation in the last analysis (short rains assessment), there has been a general improvement across the ASAL counties, from 4.4 million people in IPC AFI Phase 3 or above in February 2023 and 5.4 million in March – June 2023 to 2.8 million in the current period of this analysis. ([IPC, 1 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3993828/))

In the pastoral areas, area-level Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes persist in Turkana, Marsabit, and Mandera and among households still recovering from the drought and the widespread flooding. Despite the flood impacts, the rains have supported improvements in livestock production and household access to milk as livestock remains in wet season grazing areas, and milk production has increased. The current favorable conditions are expected to persist until the start of the forecast above average 2024 March to May long rains, which will likely support further improvements in livestock production, household access to food and income, facilitating area-level Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes over the February to May 2024 period.

More than 228,000 people died in 14 countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia, and as far away as Africa; most were women – in some places three times the number of men – the elderly and children. The dead included citizens of 40 nations, and the damage totaled nearly US$10 billion. In all, nearly 2.5 million people were affected, losing their families, their homes, and their means of making even a meagre living. All these people already were vulnerable, with many of them chronically poor, subject to wide inequalities within their own societies, displacement, environmental issues from over fishing and deforestation, human rights violations, and longstanding armed conflicts. Households headed by women particularly were pushed deeper into poverty. When the tsunami was finished, it was the most destructive disaster of its kind in history.

Humanitarian partners working with the Federal Government had so far reached over 72,000 people in 25 districts with some form of assistance across the country. The floods destroyed and damaged infrastructure including some 3,080 shelters, 4,702 latrines, three schools and killed at least 100 livestock. Shallow wells were submerged and some destroyed, which in turn, posed a risk of cholera outbreak. Additionally, hectares of agricultural land were inundated by the floods, jeopardizing food security and might lead to an increase in price instability. According to humanitarian partners, at least 770,000 people could be affected by the time the Gu season ends.  ([OCHA, 10 May 2024](https://reliefweb.int/node/4061419/))

As of 14 May, the number of people affected by the ongoing rains had risen to 225,759 people including 38,727 people displaced and 9 deaths, according to the authorities. At least 3,000 people had been relocated. Across Somalia, the heavy rains and flash floods have resulted in the loss of livelihoods, including livestock, cropland, damaged small businesses and destroyed infrastructure including shelter (3,367 destroyed and 870 affected), water sources (29 water points), latrines (5,002), schools (7), and damaged roads.

The rains affected some 268,359 people and killed 10. The number of people displaced significantly rose to 81,000 from 38,700 reported on 19 May after the Shabelle River broke its banks in Belet Weyne district, displacing 42,600 people in Koshin, Haawo taako, Buundoweye, and Howlwadaag areas. At least 9,000 of those displaced in Belet Weyne reportedly returned to their homes and another 30,000 people were expected to return in the next two weeks. Schools in Belet Weyne town re-opened. In Dhobley and Afmadow, Jubaland State, some 24,000 people who were displaced went  back to their homes due to prevailing dry conditions.  Meanwhile, the spill over of Tropical Storm Laly reportedly led to the drowning of eight children in Marka town, Lower Shabelle on 23 May, according to the local community. Cases of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera have risen across the country.

The Federal Government of Somalia has declared an emergency in areas where torrential deyr (October to December) rains have triggered floods, according to the Somalia Disaster Management Agency (SoDMA). The heavy rains fueled by an El Nino, have intensified particularly in Puntland, Galmudug, South West, Hirshabelle states and in areas along the Juba river in Jubaland State. Partners estimate that as of 6 November, over 706,100 people have been temporarily affected, with over 113,690 people temporarily displaced from their homes across the country. South West and Jubaland states are the worst affected, with an estimated 268,243 and 268,365 people affected, respectively. In Hirshabelle, at least 145,800 people are reportedly affected, with 11,700 displaced following heavy rains on 5 November. Up to 400 families (2,400 people) are believed to be trapped by floods in Luuq and efforts are ongoing to urgently evacuate them. In Baardheere, local authorities are appealing for urgent support for more than 14,000 families that have been cut off from the main town and are unable to replenish their domestic supplies.

The recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar. [(OCHA, 17 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3738815)

The ongoing Gu’ rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week.

The storm left behind a significant physical and economic damage especially in Bari region. More than 700 houses were destroyed, several boats and fishing gears damaged and loss of a large number of livestock. This has led to loss of livelihood for most families and may take time and huge financial input to replace the loss.

The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) raised its impact score to “ORANGE” (1.5 out of 3) and forecast the expected level of humanitarian impact of the cyclone as “MEDIUM”: It brought more than a year’s worth of rain to the region in two days. By 25 November 2020, TC GATI had dissipated but it left trail of destruction across Bari and Sanaag regions of Somalia. Coastal communities have been disproportionately affected, with considerable damage reported to infrastructure, livelihoods, and social services (communication, electricity, roads, schools). Rainfall has also resulted in flooding which has caused sewerage to overflow; and increasing the risk of disease among the affected population. According to authorities, an estimated 180,000 people (30,000 households) have been affected, with 42,000 people (7,000 households) displaced across Puntland and Somaliland (UNOCHA).

Normally, the Sept/Oct—Dec rainy season is expected to start in late September in the northern parts and mid October in the southern areas of the country. The Ethiopian highlands, which contribute to the Juba and Shabelle river flow, continued to receive moderate rains over the last one week. ([FAO, 24 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672960))

The 2020 Deyr rainy season has started with moderate to significantly heavy rains reported in Puntland and central regions of Hiraan, Bakool, Galgaduud, Mudug, Nugaal and southern areas of Sool region. The communities living in the riverine areas along Juba and Shabelle rivers are at high risk of flooding. As heavy rains are expected to continue in November and December, scaling up of livelihoods, improving and supporting health services and WASH facilities is vital in order to prevent further deterioration in food security and escalation of the public health crisis.

Hagaa season (June-September) riverine and flash floods have affected over 555,000 people in Hirshabelle, South West, Jubaland states as well as Sanaag and Banadir regions; of whom about 363,000 have been displaced from their homes. Over 85 per cent of the displacement occurred in the two most affected regions in the Shabelle river basin - Lower Shabelle (South West State) and Middle Shabelle (Hirshabelle State). The floods have inundated thousands of hectares of farmland and damaged property, irrigation infrastructure, water points and roads. Livelihoods have been disrupted and cases of acute watery diarrheoa have increased. The floods hit Somalia at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic have exacerbated humanitarian needs.Despite operational challenges, humanitarian partners scaled up first line response to flood affected populations, namely food assistance, health services, WASH services and emergency shelter and non-food items.

As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. [OCHA, 24 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3618914))

Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland).

The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu’ rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters.

Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. ([OCHA, 16 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635539))

As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641339))

Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region.

The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood.

The probability of the TS landing in the coastal areas of Puntland has increased from (10% TO 35%) over the last two days and is expected to make a land fall in Nugaal region in the next 24 hours.The influence of PAWAN may start being felt in the coastal areas of Bari, Mudug and Sanaag regions in the next 12 hours where moderate to heavy rains and strong winds are expected. The rains will then spread further inland to many areas within Somaliland, Puntland and central regions on 07 and 08 December 2019. ([FAO, 6 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3427818))

As Pawan turns and tracks towards Somalia, it is expected that the strength will intensify. Under the current conditions, Pawan is expected to make landfall within the next 30 hours and based on the current trajectory, the cyclone will make landfall in Puntland and some parts of Somaliland, namely Awdal and Sannag regions. Strong winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall are expected to cause flooding and trigger landslides, resulting in casualties, as well as damages to crops livelihoods, livestock, infrastructure and housing. Based on the current trajectory, the tropical cyclone could make landfall affecting the Bosaso IDP Camp in Bari Region of Puntland. The total population of the three provinces most likely to be affected is 2.3 million, however it is difficult to estimate the proportion that live on the coast, as some 65% of the population are nomadic. ([IFRC, 6 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3428688))    

Heavy rain in the last 5 days has affected northern, central and coastal Somalia. On 7 December, Puntland coast was affected by Tropical Storm PAWAN and 2 people died following floods in Las Qoray (Sanaag Region). Roads connecting the town to the rest of the region have been damaged. In central Somalia, the overflow of the River Shabelle flooded Afgooye district, displacing over 1,500 people.

All villages in the north of Belet Weyne town have been affected and humanitarian partners are yet to establish the number of people displaced in these areas. The situation is further compounded by flooding from an outburst of minor tributaries in Belet Weyne, which has caused damage to farmland in villages such as Hawo Taako. Significant portions of crop land were also flooded in Bardheere in Gedo region, (where the river is already at bank full) and Bualle.

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land.

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea.

Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia.

[...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

A cVDPV2 outbreak in the Horn of Africa has been detected in Somali province, **Ethiopia**. The virus was isolated from an AFP case with onset of paralysis on 20 May 2019. Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in **Kenya**. Currently, Somalia has reported three cVDPV2 cases in 2019. Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared this outbreak – together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia – to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response. Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa specifically between Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, as well as suboptimal subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, the Horn of Africa is considered at high-risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2.

According to SWALIM, the forecast for the coming week calls for clear weather, with the exception of coastal areas of Lower Shabelle and Lower Juba in Jubaland State. This signifies the gradual end of the 2018 Gu rainy season, which has seen above-average rainfall during April and early May. Some river breakages have not yet been closed in the mid-lower parts of the Shabelle river and therefore there remains a moderate risk of flooding.

However, the number of new measles cases reported has decreased by 29% from 302 in week 50 to 213 in week 51. This reduction is linked to scaling up of vaccination campaigns by outreach teams deployed by WHO in drought affected districts. Of the 17 093 suspected measles cases reported, 77% (13 090) are children below five years of age. ([WHO, 12 Jan 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3923365))

The number of suspected cases of measles reported through the AFP/Polio surveillance system in 2023 decreased by three-fold compared to the same period in 2022. This reduction in cases is linked to an increase in the number of children vaccinated mainly in IDP camps by WHO supported outreach teams that have scaled up the provision of integrated primary health care services including vaccination services to these camps. (Figure 4). A total of 3006 cases of measles were reported from week 1 to week 19 of 2023 of which 2090(69.5%) are children under 5.

Recurrent cholera outbreaks have been reported in the drought-affected districts of Somalia since 2022, with no interruption in transmission in Banadir region since 2017. The number of cholera cases reported in drought and flood affected districts have increased in 2023 compared to the same time over the past two years (Figure 1). This increase is attributed to a higher proportion of people with limited access to safe water and uncontrolled cross border movement in Somalia and neighboring countries triggered by drought.  Since epidemiological week 1 of 2023, a total of 15 171 cases of suspected cholera and 42 deaths (Case Fatality Rate 0.3%) were reported from 25 drought and four flood-affected districts of which 8 153 (53.7%) cases were children under 5, 7860 (51.8%) were women and 7197(47.4%) were severe cases.([WHO, 29 Sep 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/4018549))

Those affects are now emerging in other areas of the country, specifically in Jubaland in the south.

The humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people – half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1907713))

As of 31 May 2017, there had been an estimated 739,000 drought displacements since November 2016...More than 480,000 of the displaced, or 65 per cent, are under the age of 18. Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced — and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. ([UNHCR, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068029))

3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)’s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. ([OCHA, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2084594))

While the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2197699))

Humanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. ([OCHA, 30 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299179))

Food security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short‐lived and many households will face food consumption gaps through mid‐2018. In a worst‐case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large‐scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods. ([FEWSNET, 30 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2397224))

Food security has improved significantly in many of the areas worstaffected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of large-scale humanitarian assistance and improvements in seasonal performance. Most areas of the country are currently Stressed (IPC Phase 2), though Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes exist in some areas and among IDP populations. Between July and September, in the absence of continued humanitarian assistance, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely in riverine livelihood zones and northern and central Somalia. Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is likely in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone. ([FEWSNET, 30 Jun 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2677274))

The record levels of rainfall seen during the April – June Gu rainy season have ushered in hopes of the substantial replenishment of water resources, and the restoration of cropland and livestock numbers across many areas of Somalia. The latest food security outlook by the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reports that food security will improve significantly in many of the areas worst-affected by the 2016/17 drought, as a result of improvements in seasonal performance supported by large-scale humanitarian assistance. However, the magnitude and intensity of the rains, coupled with the subsequent flooding, has aggravated vulnerabilities. Vulnerable communities, still recovering from the adverse effects of protracted drought, are among those who have been most severely affected by flooding. ([OCHA, 05 Jul 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2685429))

Due to the above-average rains in the first half of 2018 and sustained humanitarian assistance, the number of people facing severe food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 and above) has decreased by 52 per cent from 3.1 million in September 2017 to 1.5 million in September 2018. However, the IPC Phase 2 caseload remained virtually unchanged, with a reduction of only 0.6 per cent. Due to the mid-2018 Gu rainy season, total cereal production exceeded the long-term average (1995-2017) by approximately 17 per cent and is 58 per cent higher than the five-year average (2013-17). Favourable rainfall between April and June 2018 also improved pasture and water availability for livestock and bolstered market conditions in some areas. Notwithstanding the relative improvement in food security outcomes since the end of the 2016/17 drought, similar gains were not observed with respect to malnutrition, which is influenced by several factors, including healthcare, clean water, proper sanitation and good hygiene practices. Malnutrition rates across Somalia remain very high and, in 2019, nearly 1 million children will be acutely malnourished, including more than 177,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. ([OCHA, 20 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2956964))

The combined impact of the initial, and potentially complete, failure of the 2019 Gu’ rains (April-June), which followed a poor 2018 Deyr season (October-December), and abnormally hot, dry conditions during the 2019 Jilaal season (January-March) has caused widespread crop failure and accelerated decline in livestock productivity, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity crisis phase, or worse. The signs of crisis, such as irregular pastoral migration coupled with deteriorating livestock body conditions and reduction in milk production, increased displacement due to drought and increases in drought-related disease, are already widely observed. Out of 5.4 million expected to be acutely food insecure by July, 2.2 million will be in severe acute food insecurity conditions (IPC 3 and above), a 40 per cent increase from January this year. ([OCHA, 20 May 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3134518))

Two years after the prolonged 2016/2017 drought destroyed livelihoods and displaced almost one million Somalis - but also triggered a massive and successful scale up in humanitarian response to avert famine - severe climatic conditions, combined with other persistent drivers of humanitarian crisis, armed conflict, protracted and continued displacement and a spike in evictions of internally displaced persons are again pushing Somalia towards a major humanitarian emergency. ([OCHA, 12 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3212214/))

The Horn of Africa (HoA) (including northeast Uganda) is currently experiencing a prolonged drought, largely as a result of below average precipitation from the seasonal short rains (April-July) and long rains (October-December). Prevailing dry conditions across the region have led to the deterioration of farmland and pastures, loss of livestock, sharply increased food prices, and reduction of the availability of water in large areas of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. At the regional level, the number of severely food insecure people has increased to approximately 12 million, in large part as a result of the drought. Pre-existing protection, health, WASH, and shelter needs have been also been exacerbated. The humanitarian needs of the region’s growing displaced population are of particular concern. ([ACAPS, 22 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3224738/))

Climatic shocks, conflict, natural disasters, widespread poverty, insecurity and vulnerability have trapped millions of Somalis in severe hunger and malnutrition for years. Late and erratic rains during the 2019 Gu’ cropping season (April-June) coupled with low river levels resulted in the poorest cereal harvest since 2011, which shattered the already fragile food security situation in the country. According to the 2019 Post-Gu’ results cereal production was up to 70 per cent below average in the southern areas for the Gu’ 2019 cropping season. If timely assistance is not provided, some 2.2 million people are expected to experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) food security outcomes through December, and one million children are projected to be acutely malnourished in 2020, including 180,000 who are likely to be severely malnourished. On the upside, the October-December 2019 Deyr rains forecast and initial performance has been positive, which would lead to improvements in food security. ([OCHA, 22 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3452938))

Most of the main IDP settlements are currently classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Given the level of destitution among IDPs and their limited livelihood options, their food security situation is unlikely to improve significantly during the projection period (February-June 2020). Urban Beletwyene is currently classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) when considering the positive impact of humanitarian assistance. Food security outcomes are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between December 2019 and June 2022 as they will be facing food consumption gasps that they will not be able to reduce without continued humanitarian assistance.([FEWSNET/FSNAU, 27 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3457643))

General acute malnutrition (GAM) is above the 15 per cent threshold in 10 of the 33 areas which experienced below average rainfall in 2019. Up to 178,000 children are expected to be impacted by severe acute malnutrition (SAM) between July 2019 and June 2020. Adding to these challenges was the presence at the end of 2019 of locusts infesting the countryside and destroying crops. As a result, it is expected in 2020 that up to 2.1 million people are expected to face food consumption gaps with 6.3 million facing acute food insecurity. ([UNICEF, 31 Dec 2019.](https://reliefweb.int/node/3493448))

Despite above-average national cereal crop production and improved livestock production following a largely favorable Deyr (October-December) rainy season, up to 1.3 million people across Somalia are expected to face food consumption gaps or depletion of assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3)1 or worse outcomes through mid-2020. ([FEWSNET/FSNAU, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504758))

From February to September 2020, the population in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phases 3 (Crisis) and 4 (Emergency) is expected to rise by 40 percent, from 1.1 million to 1.6 million people. An additional 2.9 million people are projected to be in IPC Phase 2 (stressed). ([FAO, 18 Mar 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3568878))

Humanitarian food assistance needs are high across Somalia, where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes remain widespread. An estimated 3.5 million people in rural livelihood zones, urban areas, and IDP settlements need food assistance. Furthermore, a long-term decline in rainfall performance and preliminary climatological research suggest an elevated likelihood of below-average rainfall in the March to May 2021 season. Two consecutive poor seasons would likely result in rapidly worsening acute food insecurity in 2021.  ([FEWSNET, 31 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504758))

In late 2020, the population facing food consumption gaps indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes is likely to reach 2.1 million. In early to mid-2021, the acutely food insecure population is likely to rise over 2.5 million due to the impact of consecutive, below-average rainfall seasons on crop and livestock production. Sustained humanitarian food assistance is required to prevent Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes and protect livelihoods. ([FEWSNET, 15 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3688150))

Many parts of Somalia are currently experiencing drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr (October-December) season rainfall which was characterized by depressed rains with poor spatial and temporal distributions and harsh conditions during the typically dry Jiaall (January-March) season. The worst affected regions include Lower Juba, Middle Juba, Gedo, Mudug, Nuugal, Bari, Toghdheer and Sool which are currently experiencing severe water shortage for domestic use, water for livestock as well as agricultural production. ([FAO, 25 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3724525))

The already dire humanitarian situation in 2021 will likely be exacerbated by another drought. Already in 2021, more than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by year end, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced. ([OCHA, 26 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3733064))

Nearly 40,000 people are facing mild to moderate drought conditions, as well as moderate to severe water shortages in Puntland, Galmudug, South West, Jubaland states and Banadir region, according to local authorities and partners. The situation resulted from the failure of the October-December 2020 rainy season, a harsh January - March 2021 season and a poorly distributed March-April-June season. The worst affected areas are Middle Juba, Gedo and parts of Bay and Bakool, which are experiencing moderate drought conditions, according to FAO SWALIM. Preliminary indications are that mild to moderate drought conditions may persist in many parts of Somalia until early 2022. ([OCHA, 9 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3772421))

Between July and September 2021, over 2.2 million people experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This figure is projected to drastically increase to 3.5 million between October and December 2021, and include poor rural, urban and displaced populations across Somalia. The projection is based on the assumed absence of humanitarian assistance. Moreover, approximately 1.2 million children under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished through July 2022, including nearly 213 400 likely severely malnourished ([IPC, 12 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3791104))

Eighty per cent of Somalia is experiencing severe drought, the result of a third consecutive failed rainfall season. DG ECHO direct monitoring in most affected locations receives multiple community alerts of livestock deaths and humanitarian suffering. Nearly 100,000 people have abandoned their homes in central and southern areas in search of food, water and pasture for their livestock, facing resource-based conflict over the diminishing resources. In Jubaland, the average cost of 20-litres of water has more than doubled and the price of sorghum more than tripled, while the value of livestock (main livelihood) has plummeted: from 250 USD paid per cattle to current 70 USD. The Juba and Shabelle river levels are low and expected to decrease further. Rainwater harvesters and shallow wells have dried up, forcing communities to rely on low yield, poor quality boreholes, heightening risks for multiple diseases. Given the seasonal forecast, with little or no rain expected through the end of November 2021, current and projected drought conditions are the worse in record for past 40 years. ([ECHO, 19 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3793221))

2.6 Million people in Somalia are facing water shortages due to severe drought conditions in Somalia. Water scarcity and drought conditions have contributed to increased water prices leading to displacements, diarrhoea-related morbidity and malnutrition in many parts of Somalia. The current worst affected regions include Gedo, Bay, Bakol, Lower Jubba, Galgadud, Mudug and parts of Bari, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag, Togdheer, and Hiraan regions. ([UNICEF, 10 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3799552))

Over 4.1 million people across Somalia, or 26 percent of the total population, need urgent humanitarian food assistance to prevent food consumption gaps or the accelerated depletion of livelihood assets indicative of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes through mid-2022. The key drivers of acute food insecurity in Somalia include the combined effects of consecutive seasons of poor and erratic rainfall distribution and conflict. Moreover, approximately 1.4 million children, or over 44 percent of the children in Somalia under the age of five are likely to be acutely malnourished, including nearly 329,500 who are likely to be severely malnourished. ([IPC, 1 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822417))

Acute food insecurity in Somalia has drastically worsened since the beginning of 2022, with an estimated 4.8 million people (or 31% of the total population) already experiencing Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes. Further and faster deterioration of the food security and nutrition situation is expected during the April to June 2022 projection period, when more than 6 million people (or 38% of the total population) are expected to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or higher) outcomes, including 1.7 million people likely in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and over 81,000 people likely in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5). In addition to the six population groups that face the risk of Famine, other areas of humanitarian concern include Southern Agropastoral, Southern Rain-fed Agropastoral of Middle and Lower Juba, and Togdheer Agropastoral livelihood zones as well as IDP settlements in Burao, Garoowe, Belet Weyne, Doolow and Kismaayo, all of which face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) between April and June 2022. ([IPC, 8 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3835838))

The number of people affected by drought has risen from 4.9 million in March to about 6.1 million in April, of whom nearly 760,000 are displaced and in urgent need of shelter, food, water and access to services such as health. ([OCHA, 20 Apr 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3842807))

Famine (IPC Phase 5) is projected to emerge in three areas of Bay Region, Somalia, in late 2022 in the absence of urgent, multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance. Although levels of acute malnutrition among children and the rate of hunger-related deaths have not yet met the IPC’s technical definition of Famine (IPC Phase 5), those thresholds are expected to be reached during the October to December 2022 projection period based on currently available information that minimal humanitarian food assistance will be delivered in these areas in November and December due to funding constraints. The IPC analysis – conducted by experts across multiple agencies, including FEWS NET and FSNAU – has previously warned that up to 7.1 million people across Somalia need urgent, multi-sectoral assistance ii in order to treat and prevent acute malnutrition and reduce the number of ongoing hunger-related deaths. Additionally, for months now FEWS NET, FSNAU, and IPC partners have been warning that eight areas in Somalia, inclusive of Bay, faced a Risk of Famine. iii Although provision of food and nutrition assistance is currently ongoing, levels of assistance have not kept pace with the scale and severity of needs amid a two-year drought, protracted conflict, and record high staple food prices.

By the end of September, 1,170,842 people had been displaced by drought since January 2021. Drought displaced 68,393 people in September 2022, a 31 per cent decrease from August 2022. Bay region (26 per cent) and Lower Juba region (22 per cent) have seen the most new arrivals, followed by Gedo, Banadir, and Bakool regions (14 per cent, 11 per cent and 11 per cent respectively). ([IOM, OCHA, UNHCR, 10 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3894485))

Amid an anticipated scale-down in humanitarian assistance starting in April 2023 due to insufficient funding, approximately 8.3 million people across Somalia are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse acute food insecurity outcomes between April and June 2023. This unprecedented level of need within Somalia is driven by the impacts of five consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, a likely sixth season of below-average rainfall from March to June 2023, and exceptionally high food prices, exacerbated by concurrent conflict/insecurity and disease outbreaks. Furthermore, Famine (IPC Phase 5) is projected between April and June 2023 among agropastoral populations in Baidoa and Burhakaba districts of Bay region and among internally displaced people (IDP) in Baidoa town of Bay region and in Mogadishu. ([FEWSNET, FSNAU, IPC, 13 Dec 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3915706))

During the IPC analysis conducted in January 2023, three population groups were identified as facing a Risk of Famine between April and June 2023: agropastoral communities in Burhakaba district (Bay region), internally displaced people (IDPs) in Mogadishu settlements, and IDPs in Baidoa settlements. In March 2023, follow-up integrated food security, nutrition, and mortality surveys were conducted in these three areas in order to monitor the current situation. The survey conducted in agropastoral Burhakaba also included agropastoral populations in Baidoa district given the recent history of extreme food insecurity, nutrition, and mortality outcomes in Baidoa and the resultant need for updated information in the district. In April 2023, an IPC analysis update was conducted for the surveyed areas. For the rest of the country, the results of the February 2023 IPC analysis remain valid.

Nov 2013. The cyclone and the subsequent flash floods caused massive destruction resulting in the deaths of 162 people, displacement of tens of hundreds of nomads, decimation of approximately 1 million livestock and destruction of over 1,000 houses according to Government statistics. 
 
Livelihoods for the pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and fishermen suffered severe losses with the 
pastoralists losing between 70 to 90 percent of their entire livestock. The farmers who depended on 
irrigation lost their entire crops and equipment used for pumping water. The fishermen had their boats 
damaged and their fishing gear destroyed by the flood waters. 
 
The Government of Puntland declared a natural disaster on 11 Nov and requested international assistance to assist the people of Puntland. Critical assistance required by the affected people started arriving on 14 November 2013, with contributions received from major humanitarian organizations led by the Government of Puntland. 
 
By the beginning of December, the focus was on recovery efforts. Most of the roads, which were previously cut off, are now accessible and donations of food and non-food items are streaming into the affected communities. As of 24 Nov, over 5,000 households had received food and NFIs from various agencies including the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the International Organization for Migration, Puntland Government, the local and Somalia Diaspora community.

In response to a deadly Hepatitis E outbreak in South Sudan, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has launched a mass vaccination campaign in collaboration with the Ministry of Health to safeguard women and girls of reproductive age, who are at greatest risk of death from the disease. Since April 2023, 501 cases of Hepatitis E have been treated at the MSF hospital in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, and 21 people have died—mainly women. The fatality can be as high as 40 percent for pregnant women, and there is no cure, meaning that many people with advanced stages of illness do not survive. MSF's vaccination campaign is the first to be conducted during the acute stages of an active Hepatitis E outbreak anywhere in the world. It is made more challenging by the remoteness and isolation of the area of South Sudan where it is taking place. But if the campaign succeeds, it will save lives.

The country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don’t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))

Most communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting.

In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. ([ECHO, 14 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3661817/))

More than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country.The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement. ([OCHA, 3 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3667252/))

Widespread flooding continued in October, affecting over half of the country and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. An estimated 856,000 people were affected by flooding since July with some 400,000 people displaced. ([OCHA, 6 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3686200/))

An estimated 1,042,000 people have been affected by floods in South Sudan. Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area are the worst affected (a total of 495,000 people affected). Flood-affected people’s urgent needs include food and livelihood support, emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI), and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and protection services. Flood-response activities have been considerably constrained by persistent heavy rains, infrastructure damage and reduced physical accessibility and insecurity. There is an urgent need for additional logistic support with dedicated air assets and riverine transport to transport cargo to multiple locations prioritized for flood response.

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

Several days of torrential rains have left wide swaths of Greater Jonglei devastated and its inhabitants both flabbergasted and displaced. With more precipitation on the forecasted horizon, there are fears that the situation may deteriorate further. Nearly one million people in South Sudan have been affected, while the UN Children’s Fund, Unicef, say that some 490,000 of the victims are children ([UNMISS, 29 Oct 2019.](https://reliefweb.int/node/3369259))


Response activities have been scaled-up across the affected locations where floods devastated the lives and livelihoods of some 908,000 people. As of 29 November, about 7,000 metric tons of food commodities have been distributed, reaching some 704,000 people with emergency food assistance.

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from **Uganda**. It is also known to be present in **Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda**. The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties [in **Kenya**]. [FAO] and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. ([OCHA, UNCT Kenya, 23 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2041984))

In collaboration with [FAO] and other development partners, the Government of **Ethiopia** has intensified efforts to protect major maize growing areas from the ravage of the fall armyworm. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52 962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states – Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR)...The Government of Ethiopia allocated nearly USD 2 million to tackle the problem. ([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In **Kenya**, the pest has so far affected about 200 000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected. ([FAO, 14 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2122994))

([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. ([FEWSNET, 28 Feb 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3016143))

FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in **Ethiopia**. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3276678))

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

Material damage is estimated at 2,067 houses completely destroyed. Due to lack of real-time information, this estimate does not represent all the damage (information provisionally made available by OCHA on 5 August 2022 in the snapshot). During the week of 01 to 7 August 2022, the successive heavy rainfall in N'Djamena, combined with the low-lying position of the Gozator hospital and the lack of drainage in its vicinity caused the main basin behind it to overflow and led to an unprecedented flooding of the hospital.

Some 380,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the river Nile, Sudd wetlands and the rivers Lol and Sobat since May. **Jonglei** and **Unity** states are the worst affected. Early seasonal rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements across the top of the country, with more heavy rains and flooding expected in the coming months. Many of the flood-affected people moved to higher grounds within their county, and plan to return home once the flood waters recede. Some 100,000 people, mostly from **Twic East**, who were displaced by the 2020 floods, still have not returned home and are sheltering in the Bor and Mangalla IDP camps, and in Mingkaman, according to humanitarian partners.

The country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don’t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))

Most communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 – 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.

Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms. However, insecurity, violence against aid workers and access constraints continue to hamper the overall floods response. ([ECHO, 13 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895776))

While laboratory tests are still ongoing, positive environmental samples of poliovirus type 2 have also been found in seven more states, including West Darfur, East Darfur, Gezira, White Nile, River Nile, Khartoum and Red Sea, indicating a possible wide circulation of the virus within the country. At least 5.2 million children under age 5 live in the affected states and will require urgent vaccination. The outbreak, the first since March 2009, has been considered by the authorities as a national emergency and response has been activated to tackle the high risk of transmissions within and beyond Sudan, including South Sudan, declared by WHO as polio-free just a month ago. Neighbouring Ethiopia, Central African Republic and Chad also reported cases, which puts more risks on Sudan, especially in the Darfur region, due to border movements. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current floods in Sudan will likely increase the challenges for Government and humanitarian partners to contain the new outbreak. The FMoH and health partners have already activated the urgent response to the outbreak. The FMoH briefed the Cabinet of Ministers on 8 August and declared the outbreak one day later, following the protocols of the International Health Regulations.

([ECHO, 9 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668741))

At least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. ([ECHO, 22 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672284))

Rains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    

The Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))

Despite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))

The rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))

**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))

The current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.  ([FAO, 06 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3464613))

The unusually heavy rains that have impacted Eastern Africa since October 2019—driven by the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole since 2016—have contributed to a serious and widespread desert locust outbreak, according to FAO and IGAD*. **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Kenya**, **Somalia** and **Sudan** have been affected, with the outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia the worst in 25 years, and in Kenya the worst in 75 years. There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))

The Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))

The situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))

Desert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))

Across the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))

In East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))

Important and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))

According to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))

Numerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))

In **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

It is currently affecting Gedarif, White Nile, Khartoum, Sennar, River Nile, North Kordofan, and Gezira states. White Nile is host to a large South Sudanese refugee population and has had the highest number of cases so far. A state of emergency has not yet been declared and response has been limited. An underfunded health system and poor WASH facilities have contributed to the spread of infection. ([ACAPS, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2080249))

Based on the attack rate projections another 36,000 to 40,000 cases are expected over the next six to nine months, according to the FMoH and WHO. The AWD is affecting all demographics, with females constituting 54 per cent of the cases and children under five years of age accounting for 8.1 per cent. ([OCHA, 27 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2196614))

Only 78 new cases of AWD and two related deaths were reported from 8 to 14 October, down from a peak of nearly 2,000 new cases at the end of June 2017. Eight states reported active case transmissions and the only state reporting two AWD-related deaths was South Kordofan. Meanwhile, the FMoH continued to lead an active scale-up of interventions to ensure a final stop to the spread of AWD. ([OCHA, 22 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2298554))

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from **Uganda**. It is also known to be present in **Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda**. The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties [in **Kenya**]. [FAO] and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. ([OCHA, UNCT Kenya, 23 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2041984))

In collaboration with [FAO] and other development partners, the Government of **Ethiopia** has intensified efforts to protect major maize growing areas from the ravage of the fall armyworm. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52 962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states – Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR)...The Government of Ethiopia allocated nearly USD 2 million to tackle the problem. ([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation.

([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. ([FEWSNET, 28 Feb 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3016143))

FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in **Ethiopia**. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3276678))

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

An estimated 1.4 million children and 480,000 pregnant or lactating women will be acutely malnourished and in need of treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated people’s existing vulnerabilities and weakened an already fragile health system’s ability to treat people. ([OCHA, 16 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3721681))

South Sudan is one of the worst hunger crises globally, with 2.5 million people in emergency or worse levels of acute food insecurity, of which 108,000 people are estimated to already face famine-like conditions. Considering also the 4.7 million people in crisis levels, this is worst food security situation since the 2011 independence. Conflict is a main driver of food insecurity, and households' purchasing power is further diminished by high inflation.

Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia.

[...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))

In **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya.

In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))

The current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))

Desert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))

Ground teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))

Aerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))

The locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))

The few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))

 A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))

As late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))

After more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))

The current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained. ([FAO, 2 Mar 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822773))

In the neighbouring Sironko District, along the Mount Elgon slope, a devastating flood incident occurred in Buyobo Sub-County on 4th of June at around 4:00am. The continuous rains that started at 2:20am and continued consecutively for hours triggered flooding from uphill, which carried a huge mass of soil down the hills into river Bugibuni, prompting it to burst its banks and causing havoc to the communities downhill. The river carried massive water, logs of huge trees, soil debris down the slope and swept off houses and crops adjacent to it. The flash floods damaged houses of 111 households, with a population of 426 persons. Fortunately, no deaths were registered.

The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

A total of 2,874 cases and all 44 deaths from the outbreak have been reported from eight counties straddling the River Nile: Awerial, Duk, Fangak, Juba, Leer, Pageri, Pigi and Terekeka. Rubkona is the only county affected by the outbreak that is not along the Nile. Juba has the highest number of cases (1,990 - 63 per cent of the total), while Terekeka has the highest case fatality rate. ([OCHA, 21 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1787276))

As of 5 May 2017, cholera outbreaks have been confirmed in 19 counties in South Sudan. The most affected counties are located along the River Nile. This suggests vehicle-borne transmission from contaminated water in affected counties. Cumulatively, 7,735 cholera cases, including 246 deaths (76 facilities and 170 community) (CFR 3.23%), have been reported in South Sudan since the initial case was reported on 18 June 2016. Nine out of 19 counties ever affected since June 2016 are considered to have active transmission, having reported cholera cases in the past four weeks. ([WHO, Govt. South Sudan, 5 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2055884/))

Cholera transmission has continued to decline countrywide. In the last four weeks [weeks 37- 40] , cholera cases dropped from at least 40 cases in week 37 of 2017 to at least 15 cases in week 40 of 2017. Three counties [Juba, Budi, and Fangak] have registered cholera transmission in the last four weeks [ 37-40]. A total of 135 cases have been reported from the three counties in the last four weeks [37-40]. Most of the cases have been reported from Juba [112 cases] while Budi and Fangak reported 16 cases and 7 cases respectively. ([WHO, 6 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2281129/))

The overall case fatality rate nationally from these districts stands at 3.2%. It is estimated that 217,350 persons (38,128 households) in the affected sub-counties are at high risk of cholera infection during this outbreak, with a wider population of 900,500 people in the districts also seen as at risk due to the high mobility of people in the area. Many of the affected communities are fishing communities where lack of clean water coupled with poor sanitation and hygiene practices have contributed to the outbreak and spread of the disease. ([IFRC, 15 May 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/576384))

This DREF operation enabled URCS to expand on its intervention and complement with enhanced awareness raising activities. The operation contributed to increased public awareness about cholera (signs and symptoms, transmission risk factors, actions for suspected cases, its prevention and control measures) for 900,500 people at risk in the affected districts. The intervention also contributed to improve early detection, reporting and referral of suspected cholera cases through community based disease surveillance mechanisms. In addition, the response improved access to safe water and awareness around sanitation and hygiene practices for 4,000 vulnerable families (18,700 people) in the affected areas, specifically around hand washing practices, use of latrines, drinking of aqua safe treated or boiled water.

Since the beginning of November 2019, Rwanda has increasingly experienced heavy rains, affecting most parts of the country. As a result, many rivers across the country received huge levels of rainwater and overflew along their courses, causing flooding in Ngororero, Nyabihu, Nyamasheke and Rusizi districts in Western province, Musanze and Rulindo districts in Northern Province, and Gisagara district in Southern province. In December 2019 3,000 people were estimated to have been in evacuation centres and most of them still do not have shelter due to the disaster. More recently, from 3rd to 5th of March 2020, extensive flooding and windstorm were registered in Gisagara District and observed in other districts including Gasabo in Kigali City, Gisagara, Ngoma and Nyagatare District in Eastern Province. This led to extensive destruction of houses and crops...According to the initial assessments conducted by the Ministry of Emergency Management (MINEMA) and Rwanda Red Cross Society (RRCS) from 3rd to 5th March, it is estimated that approximately 5,220 people (1,044 households) have been affected as a result of these floods and accompanying windstorm.

The pest has been recently detected in Kenya and is suspected to have entered the country from **Uganda**. It is also known to be present in **Burundi, Ethiopia and Rwanda**. The fall armyworm was first reported in western **Kenya** by farmers in March 2017, and immediately confirmed by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service and Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation. The initial counties infested were Busia, TransNzoia, Bungoma, Uasin Gishu and Nandi. ([FAO, 25 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2002359))

As of 23 May, Fall Armyworm has affected more than 143,000 hectares of land in major maize and wheat-producing counties [in **Kenya**]. [FAO] and the Ministry of Agriculture have adopted a planning response figure of 800,000 hectares, which requires US$33.5 million for pesticides and awareness campaigns in the medium term. US$6.6 million is required for an immediate response. ([OCHA, UNCT Kenya, 23 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2041984))

In collaboration with [FAO] and other development partners, the Government of **Ethiopia** has intensified efforts to protect major maize growing areas from the ravage of the fall armyworm. The fall armyworm, which first arrived in Africa in 2016, was intercepted on a few hectares of irrigated maize fields in southern Ethiopia in the last week of February 2017. It has now covered about 52 962 hectares in 144 districts in three of the major maize-growing regional states – Gambella, Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples’ Region (SNNPR)...The Government of Ethiopia allocated nearly USD 2 million to tackle the problem. ([FAO, 30 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2052219))

Fall armyworm, which has caused extensive damage to maize crops in southern Africa, has spread to the east and has worsened the situation. In **Kenya**, the pest has so far affected about 200 000 hectares of crops, and in Uganda more than half the country's 111 districts are affected. ([FAO, 14 Jul 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2122994))

([FAO, 27 Sep 2018 ](https://reliefweb.int/node/2805074))

In **Uganda**, Fall Army Worm incidence during the 2019 first season is expected at levels comparable to the 2018 first season. However, the limited tendency of FAW to spread amidst above-average rainfall, coupled with some prevention efforts by the local government and farmers, could result in a significant decrease in levels of infestation and damage. ([FEWSNET, 28 Feb 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3016143))

FAW infestation continues to threaten food security to small holder farmers in **Ethiopia**. ([OCHA, 26 Aug 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3276678))

The effects of the fall armyworm (FAW) in **Kenya** were ultimately minimal, given that farmers’ use of integrated pest management combined with heavy rainfall from April onward. ([FEWSNET/WFP, 31 Oct 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3466883))

There is currently an infestation of the FAW in **Ethiopia's** East Wollega of Oromia region, and the North Shewa zone of Amhara region.Around 1,250 hectares of maize has been affected, and there is a risk it will continue to spread. The impact of the FAW on crops in conjunction with destruction caused by desert locusts will likely negatively impact agricultural production and heighten pre-existing food insecurity. ([ACAPS, 15 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3396748))

In 2018, **Ethiopia's** Ministry of Agriculture and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that the FAW caused an estimated 35% reduction in crop yields in Meher seasonal production, affecting more than 150,000 out of 770,000 hectares infested across the country. ([IPC, 20 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3403688))

According to the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), these rains are a result of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Belt and led to continous rainfall and resulting flooding which peaked on 13 May 2019. According to IGAD Climate Prediction Application Centre (ICPAC), much of southern and eastern Tanzania recorded wetter than normal rainfall condition with a few places in southern and eastern Tanzania recording severely to extremely wet rainfall conditions between 1st and 10th May 2019. On 23rd May 2019, the TMA issued a weather information update stating that rains will continue with significant impact; floods, fishing activities to be interfered, transport network impaired, socioeconomic/ livelihood will be damaged and increased risk of waterborne and vector borne disease outbreak.

The floods caused a significant impact to the people in Dar es salaam leading to damage of properties and livelihoods and putting the affected population at risk of diseases. The initial rapid assessment conducted by TRCS from May 20 to May 23rd, indicated that the heavy rains have caused serious flooding in Kinondoni, Temeke and Ilala municipalities of Dar es Salaam. The rains which fell upstream affected eight (8) out of twenty-seven (27) wards of Kinondoni municipality, eleven (11) out of twenty-four (24) Wards of Temeke municipality and eight (8) out of twenty-five (25) Wards of Ilala municipality.

The flooding has caused displacement of people, who are hosted by friends as well as in temporary public buildings, mainly schools, mosques and churches. A total of 1215 HH have been displaced (from the 1560 HH affected). There is a widespread destruction of physical infrastructure, particularly roads and bridges, some of which have been completely damaged/broken, interfering with communication between neighbouring places within and outside the municipality. The flooding has caused significant damage to houses and has swept away personal household items and belongings as well as other properties including poultry.

Malawi, which now has an estimated 3.3 million people in Crisis or Emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4), and Zimbabwe, where nearly 2.4 million people are in Crisis or Emergency, have the highest numbers of severely food insecure people in the region. Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique.  ([OCHA, 26 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2889353))

Since the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid‑December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ([GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2960209))

Approximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns.

FEWS NET anticipates the next lean season will most likely start atypically early in August/September in several areas of the region, and households will have limited purchasing power due to lower incomes. Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time.

An estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food insecure this year. When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year, food insecurity increased by 28%. It is also 7.4% higher than it was during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2016/17. ([SADC, 11 Jul 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3210729))

The overall food security situation in the region is deteriorating and the number of severely food insecure people is rising in some countries, reaching a peak between October 2019 and March 2020. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes prevail in cyclone affected areas of Mozambique and Zimbabwe and areas significantly affected by the drought and the deteriorating macro-economic context in Zimbabwe. Emergency (IPC 4) outcomes prevail in parts of Southern Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Eswatini. Poor crop performance due to variable and late rainfall affected significant portions of Lesotho, Eswatini, southern Madagascar, and southern Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, while the impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth caused damage and destruction to harvests in eastern Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, and central and north Mozambique.

By the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of **Madagascar**, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In **Mozambique**, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province—which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October—and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In **Zimbabwe**, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021.

Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern **Madagascar** due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado **Mozambique** and parts of the **DRCongo**. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, **DRCongo**, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government’s declaration of martial law. Conflict in **DRC** and **Mozambique** has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in **Zimbabwe**, **Malawi**, **Lesotho**, and most parts of **Mozambique** are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September.

Of this population, 286,000 people are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 50,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). An additional 376,000 are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and require livelihood support. Compared to the October 2021 - March 2022 projection period from the August 2021 analysis, this update shows a slight deterioration, with a slight increase in the food insecure population in IPC Phase 3 or above in all livelihood zones except for Highveld Cattle and Maize, Timber Highlands and Moist Middleveld, with the latter two having 47% of their households having food stocks lasting more than six months. This update has seen the population projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above increase by 19,000 people. ([IPC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811185))

**Tanzania**: For the current period of analysis (November 2021 - April 2022), about 437,000 people, representing 13% of an analysed population of 3.4 million, are estimated to be experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Overall, an estimated 22,000 people (1% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) and around 415,000 people (12% of the population analysed) in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). Around 785,000 people (23% of the population analysed) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). Amongst the 14 councils of Tanzania analysed (12 district councils [DCs] and the rural parts of two town councils [TCs]), four councils (Handeni DC, Longido, Mkinga, and Monduli) are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), with 20% to 30% of their population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (Phase 3 or above). The rest of the councils are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed). [(IPC, 1 Mar 2022)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3822422/))

Approximately 5.4 million people in Malawi living in rural and secondary urban centres are facing Moderate or Severe chronic food insecurity (IPC CFI Levels 3 and 4) due to abject poverty and recurrent shocks, among other drivers. The February Malawi IPC Chronic Food Insecurity (CFI) analysis found that an additional estimated 4.4 million people face Mild food insecurity, whilst approximately 6.9 million people face No/Minimal chronic food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity in Malawi, where over 70% of the population of about 19.1 million people is living below the international poverty line of $1.90/day, is driven by abject poverty, recurrent shocks, poor policies and implementation as well as reliance on weak livelihood strategies.

([SADC, 13 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1858434))

A fall armyworm outbreak, the first emergence of the pest in southern Africa, is causing considerable crop damage in some countries. If the pest damage aggravates, it could dampen prospects for good crop harvests that is anticipated in the current farming season. Maize, a staple food in the region, has been the most affected, as well as other cereals including sorghum, millet and wheat. Southern Africa is reeling from the effects of two consecutive years of El Niño-induced drought that affected over 40 million people, reduced food availability by 15 percent and caused a cereal deficit of 9 million tonnes. ([FAO, 3 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1888559))

Sixteen East and Southern African countries agreed on 16 February on urgent plans of action aimed at boosting the region’s capacity to manage emerging crop pests and livestock diseases, including armyworm and avian influenza ... Zambia has reported that almost 90 000 hectares of maize have been affected, forcing farmers to replant their crops. In Malawi some 17 000 hectares have so far been affected while in Namibia, approximately 50 000 hectares of maize and millet has been damaged and in Zimbabwe up to 130 000 hectares could be affected thus far. ([FAO, 16 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1905658))

The first 20 days of April saw an increase in rainfall in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa, after a relatively dry March. Rainfall tapered off in late April, although some areas in Zimbabwe and central Mozambique received higher than usual rainfall amounts for this time of year ... The excessive rainfall in some areas also appears to have helped suppress the impact of the fall armyworm, a new pest which has invaded 11 SADC countries. ([SADC, 28 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2013529))

Preliminary assessments, conducted between mid-February and the end of April 2017, showed that approximately 356,000 hectares of crops were affected by the fall armyworm infestation in seven reporting Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) member states: Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zambia.

The region has been experiencing the impacts of the Fall Armyworm (FAW) since late 2016 with reports of infestations in all countries (except Lesotho and Mauritius)...Case studies conducted in 2017 in Zambia and Mozambique indicated farmer perceptions of localized FAW incidences ranging between 25%-50% and 5%-77% respectively, with a marginal impact to date.

province of Aceh, causing a tsunami that accelerate to speeds of more than 600 kilometres per hour and barreled one-fifth of the way around the earth.  More than 228,000 people died in 14 countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia, and as far away as Africa; most were women – in some places three times the number of men – the elderly and children. The dead included citizens of 40 nations, and the damage totaled nearly US$10 billion. In all, nearly 2.5 million people were affected, losing their families, their homes, and their means of making even a meagre living. All these people already were vulnerable, with many of them chronically poor, subject to wide inequalities within their own societies, displacement, environmental issues from over fishing and deforestation, human rights violations, and longstanding armed conflicts. Households headed by women particularly were pushed deeper into poverty. When the tsunami was finished, it was the most destructive disaster of its kind in history.
