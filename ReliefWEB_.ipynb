The use of unsafe water from contaminated water points is the most likely cause of this outbreak. Limited access to water and sanitation (WASH) services, poor hygiene practices, including open defecation and lack of water treatment options are among the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease across these three woredas.

This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one\\u2011quarter of the country\\u2019s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis.The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.([FAO, 07 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3986886))\\n### Appeals & Response Plans\\n\\n- [![IFRC: Djibouti: Hunger Crisis - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF Operation no.

([OCHA, 14 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3800557))\\n\\nThe country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don\\u2019t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))\\n\\nMost communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 \\u2013 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.

Eastern Equatoria and Western Equatoria states that have not been affected by 2021 floods are now reported flooded. In Unity, floodwater levels have risen above the level measured in 2021 by 10 centimeters. Reports indicate that heavy rains and floods have destroyed crops, people\\u2019s homes, schools, health care centres, boreholes and killed people. An estimated 386,000 people have been affected based on assessments that were conducted in 18 of the 27 counties reportedly impacted by floods. ([OCHA, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3889251))\\n\\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting Western Equatoria State (south-western South Sudan) over the past days, causing floods and river overflow (in particular the Mori River) that have resulted in evacuations and damage. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) reports, as of 28 September, nearly 29,800 displaced people, a number of whom have been relocated to higher and safer grounds, mainly across Mundri West County (eastern Western Equatoria State). Humanitarian efforts are underway to aid displaced communities. ([ECHO, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3891067))\\n\\nSince late August, heavy rains and flooding impact people across the country and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area, with over 900,000 people reportedly affected. Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms. However, insecurity, violence against aid workers and access constraints continue to hamper the overall floods response. ([ECHO, 13 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895776))\\n\\nSince July 2022, an estimated 1 million people were affected by severe flooding in 36 counties across South Sudan and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area.  \\nFlood waters continue to block humanitarian access in Unity State, especially in the southern part of the state including Bentiu and into Jonglei State.

Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May, and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages. [(OCHA, 9 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3736896)    \\n\\nThe recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar. [(OCHA, 17 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3738815)\\n\\nThe ongoing Gu\\u2019 rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week. The latest forecast indicates that the continuation of these rains from late May through June is uncertain. However, the rains received triggered flash floods in some areas and will affect food security and livelihoods, with the 2021 Gu\\u2019 season cereal production expected to be 20-40% below average. Humanitarian partners estimate that at least 166,000 people have been affected by flooding since the beginning of the Gu\\u2019 season.

In April, another 305 cases tested positive out of 315 (97% positivity rate). The adjacent Lamu county has also reported a total of 224 positive cases from different health facilities where 59 are children under 5 years old. Cumulatively, 553 cases have been reported within the past 4 months of January, February, March and April, with a peak of cases in April. No deaths have been reported so far within the two counties. In both counties, cases are on the rise and urgent action needs to be taken to prevent an all-out outbreak which would endanger the lives of the population, causing a health disaster. Public health officials are warning that more cases should be expected as the seasonal \\u2018long rains\\u2019 run through to the end of May, boosting mosquito populations. Previous outbreak data and monthly trends show that annual upsurges are experienced after the short and long rainfall seasons with dual peaks in February and June. The usual trend is that the next peak would occur in June, after the long rains have subdued; however, in this case, the virus is surging at the beginning of the long rains, which will most likely make the situation worse as conditions become more conducive for the mass spread of the disease vector. There is also concern about a new variant of Dengue fever. A specialized team of experts from the Ministry of Health has been deployed in Mombasa county on 4 May 2021 to investigate this new variant of Dengue fever.

Across the state, primarily in Bor South and Twic East, some 135,000 people are believed to be displaced.([UNMISS, 8 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3660060/))\\n\\nThe situation is worsened by the onset of the rainy season, which has led to the displacement of over 5,000 people due to floods in Bor South and Twic East counties in Jonglei. According to local authorities, the number goes up to 150,000 for eastern Jonglei. ([ECHO, 11 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3660709/))\\n\\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. ([ECHO, 14 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3661817/))\\n\\nMore than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country.The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement. ([OCHA, 3 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3667252/))\\n\\nWidespread flooding continued in October, affecting over half of the country and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. An estimated 856,000 people were affected by flooding since July with some 400,000 people displaced. ([OCHA, 6 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3686200/))\\n\\nAn estimated 1,042,000 people have been affected by floods in South Sudan. Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area are the worst affected (a total of 495,000 people affected). Flood-affected people\\u2019s urgent needs include food and livelihood support, emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI), and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and protection services. Flood-response activities have been considerably constrained by persistent heavy rains, infrastructure damage and reduced physical accessibility and insecurity. There is an urgent need for additional logistic support with dedicated air assets and riverine transport to transport cargo to multiple locations prioritized for flood response.

Khartoum, Blue Nile and River Nile are amongst the most affected states. Floods have also led to damages and affected people in other regions, including El Gezira, West Kordofan and South Darfur. In the Blue Nile State, the state with highest number of people affected so far, the Bout Earth Dam, in Tadamon locality, exceeded its full capacity and collapsed, following the strong rainfall received on 29 July. At least 12 neighbourhoods downstream in Bout Town were flooded due the incident, affecting around 3,900 people. Most of them were rendered homeless and are now sheltering with host families, as nearly 190 houses were destroyed and 590 damaged, according to Government\\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). More houses are expected to collapse, as the rains continue in a zone where the land is already extremely wet. ([OCHA, 3 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658542)).\\n\\nHeavy rain continues to affect 14 of the 18 States, causing widespread floods and leading to an increasing number of casualties and damage. According to UN OCHA, at least 1,100 people have been displaced (600 in North Darfur, and 500 in White Nile State) and more than 50,000 people affected. In addition, media report 10 deaths, 3 injured and more than 3,000 houses destroyed or damaged. National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected. For the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is expected across southern States. Sudan's Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rain is expected over August and September, which risks leading to further flooding and displacement. ([ECHO, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659785))\\n\\nAn estimated 125,000 refugees and internally displaced people have been affected in total, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance. Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help, and where 15 people have tragically died and a further 23 gone missing. ([UNHCR, 1 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3666438))\\n\\nAs of 8 September, [there were] nearly 100 fatalities, 46 injured people, thousands of people displaced (and many of them sheltered in schools), and over 100,000 houses destroyed or damaged across the aforementioned States. Since mid-July, around 506,000 people have been affected across 17 States (out of 18), with more than 110,000 of them during the first week of September. In the Khartoum State around 100,000 people are currently in need of urgent shelters, household supplies, clean water, sanitation, and health services. Over the next 24 hours, moderate rain is forecast over south-west and south-east Sudan, with locally heavy rain over central North Kordofan State. ([ECHO, 9 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668741))\\n\\nAt least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. ([ECHO, 22 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672284))\\n\\nRains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.

In addition to this, the rains made travel to rural areas within the Dawa zone difficult. ([OCHA, 6 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3632191))\\n\\nDuring the months of April and May 2020, heavy and prolonged belg/gu rains led to flooding and landslide incidents in Somali, Oromia, Afar, SNNP and Dire Dawa. Latest National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) reports indicate that close to 470,163 people are affected and 301,284 people are displaced by floods across the country. ([OCHA, 22 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3637479))\\n\\nOverall, at least 151,828 people were affected by recent floods (July and August), including 100,176 people displaced as of mid-August, including 40,731 people displaced in Afar, 20,868 people displaced in Somali, 1,125 people displaced in Oromia (excluding the 141 people displaced by landslide in East Wollega zone), 25,703 people displaced in SNNP and 11,749 people displaced in Gambella. ([OCHA, 18 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3662834))\\n\\nHeavy summer season (June \\u2013 September) rains continue to cause flooding in many parts of the country. Some 500,000 people were so far affected, including some 300,000 displaced. Most recently, on 1 September, Awash River broke its embankment and flooded downstream areas in Amibara and Awash Fentale woredas of Afar region. ([OCHA, 7 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668160))\\n\\nIn Ethiopia, nearly 1.1 million people have been affected by floods, including over 313,000 people displaced, with Afar, Amhara, Gambella, Oromia, Somali and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's (SNNP) regions most-affected. Across these regions, more than 1.1 million people were displaced by violence before the floods hit.

            "        \"description\": \"The 2020 Gu\\u2019 rains (April-June) have intensified across Somalia, triggering flash flooding in South West State, Jubaland, Bandir, Puntland and Somaliland from 20-23 April. As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO\\u2019s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. [OCHA, 24 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3618914))\\n\\nSince 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). ([ECHO, 29 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3625054))\\n\\nThe number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu\\u2019 rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. ([OCHA, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633360))\\n\\nOngoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. ([OCHA, 16 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635539))\\n\\nAs of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641339))\\n\\nFlash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. ([OCHA, 26 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658337))\\n\\nThe latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia\\u2019s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. ([UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659748))\\n\\nRiverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

The probability of the TS landing in the coastal areas of Puntland has increased from (10% TO 35%) over the last two days and is expected to make a land fall in Nugaal region in the next 24 hours.The influence of PAWAN may start being felt in the coastal areas of Bari, Mudug and Sanaag regions in the next 12 hours where moderate to heavy rains and strong winds are expected. The rains will then spread further inland to many areas within Somaliland, Puntland and central regions on 07 and 08 December 2019. ([FAO, 6 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3427818))\\n\\nAs Pawan turns and tracks towards Somalia, it is expected that the strength will intensify. Under the current conditions, Pawan is expected to make landfall within the next 30 hours and based on the current trajectory, the cyclone will make landfall in Puntland and some parts of Somaliland, namely Awdal and Sannag regions. Strong winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall are expected to cause flooding and trigger landslides, resulting in casualties, as well as damages to crops livelihoods, livestock, infrastructure and housing. Based on the current trajectory, the tropical cyclone could make landfall affecting the Bosaso IDP Camp in Bari Region of Puntland. The total population of the three provinces most likely to be affected is 2.3 million, however it is difficult to estimate the proportion that live on the coast, as some 65% of the population are nomadic.

TC Pawan has displaced communities, impacting access to basic health services, which has left affected communities exposed to diseases. The most affected households need urgent humanitarian assistance as they are currently in dire living conditions. Damage was also sustained to IDP settlements, infrastructure and social services such as roads, schools, as well as telecommunication towers and electrical installations. The worst hit areas include Nugaal Region (Eyl and Dangorayo Districts), Karkaar (Qardho District) and Bari Region (Alula, Iskushuban, and Baargaal).

The swarms have produced hopper bands that have covered more than 174 square kilometers (in 56 woredas and 1085 kebeles) and are consuming approximately 8,700 metric tons of green vegetation every day...In Afar region, the Desert Locust is spreading to Gewane and Amibara woredas. Over 21,000 hectares (across 15 woredas) was aerially sprayed. ([OCHA, 3 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3379523))    \\n\\nThe Desert Locust (Schistocerca gregaria) infestation in **Ethiopia** has deteriorated, despite ongoing ground and aerial control operations...Hoppers have fledged, and an increasing number of small immature and mature swarms have continued to devour crop and pasture fields in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, and Somali regional states. In Amhara, some farms have registered nearly 100 percent loss of teff, a staple crop in Ethiopia. Moreover, eggs are hatching profusely and forming hopper bands in the Somali region, due to the heavy rainfall. The hopper bands recorded to date have covered more than 351 km2 and are consuming at least 1 755 000 MT of green vegetation per day...If not controlled, the Desert Locusts could continue moving within Ethiopia and invade northeast **Kenya**, the western lowlands and highlands of **Eritrea**, the Red Sea coastal plains in Eritrea, and adjacent southern coastal areas in Sudan. ([FAO, 7 Nov 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3383708))\\n\\nDespite major control and prevention operations, substantial crop losses have already occurred in the Amhara and Tigray regions of **Ethiopia**. The hopper bands -- young locust populations moving together -- have covered nearly 430 square kilometres and have consumed about 1.3 million metric tonnes of vegetation over a two-month period. The formation of bands is ongoing in the rangelands of the Ethiopian Somali Region; and massive new swarms will arrive from Yemen and Somalia. In **Eritrea**, big swarms of immature adults that migrated from Ethiopia, were identified and controlled around Shieb, Gahtielay, Wengebo and Beareze of the Northern Red Sea Coast. Moreover, the swarms of Tree Locust have been detected in Tserona, Mai-seraw, Quatit and Digsa districts of Southern Eritrea. ([FAO, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3442723))\\n\\nThe rains have provided favourable conditions for the further breeding of locusts, resulting in total loss of vegetable, fruit and fodder crops, including free-grazing areas. The infestation represents a real threat which could trigger human and animal starvation. The locusts' destruction has impacted Arta, Ali-Sabieh (100 per cent), and Dikhil (As Eyla and Hanle areas) regions, affecting 80 per cent of the total cultivated land. There are reports indicating that the invasion is expanding to the Tadjourah and Obock regions. ([OCHA, 16 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3443308))\\n\\n**Somalia** faces the worst Desert Locust outbreak in over 25 years. Desert Locust breeding is ongoing in Galmudug (Mudug), Puntland and Somaliland. An estimated 70 000 hectares of land have been infested by hoppers and breeding adults, which have already damaged crops and pasture in **Ethiopia** and **Somalia**.  Over the next six months, more than 100 000 hectares of land will require direct control interventions in **Somalia**. ([FAO, 18 Dec 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/3447128))\\n\\nThe current situation remains extremely serious in the Horn of Africa where, despite control operations, an increasing number of swarms formed in eastern **Ethiopia**, including the Ogaden, and perhaps adjacent areas of northwest **Somalia**. Although some swarms moved to **Eritrea** and **Djibouti**, the majority moved south in the Ogaden and Somalia, and several large swarms reached **Kenya** at the end of the month. There is a risk that some swarms could possibly reach **South Sudan** and **Uganda**.

There remains a risk that locusts could appear in south-east **South Sudan** and north-east **Uganda**. ([OCHA, 17 Jan  2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3483258))\\n\\nThe Government of **Djibouti** estimates that the damage caused by the Desert Locust infestations on vegetation cover (crops and pastures) have already caused a loss of around USD 5 million for the six regions of the country. ([Djibouti Govt/FAO, 03 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3504368))\\n\\nThe situation remains extremely alarming in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** where widespread Desert Locust infestations and a new generation of breeding threatens food security and livelihoods in the region. The situation is less worrisome in **Uganda** and **Tanzania**.  ([FAO, 17 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3526299))\\n\\nDesert locusts have rapidly spread across the Greater Horn of Africa in the worst infestation in decades. Despite control efforts, eight countries in eastern Africa are now affected (**Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania**). ([FAO, 26 Feb 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3539508))\\n\\nAcross the ten countries covered by the appeal, over 365 000 ha have been controlled to date, of which an estimated 20 percent was infested by hopper bands and 80 percent by swarms. Thanks to these operations, and based on very preliminary analyses and projections of areas controlled and likely damage caused if not controlled, it is anticipated that 720 000 tonnes of cereal have already been saved, worth around USD 220 million. This is enough to feed almost 5 million people for one year. Through damage averted to rangeland and livestock tropical units, an additional 350 000 pastoral households have been spared from livelihood loss and distress. ([FAO, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633397))\\n\\nIn East Africa, only a few immature swarms remain in northwest **Kenya** where aerial control operations continue. A small third generation of breeding is likely to commence in October but may be limited by below-normal Short Rains that are predicted for this year. In northeast **Ethiopia**, numerous hopper bands are present mainly in the Afar region from substantial breeding. Although aerial control operations are in progress, new swarms are likely to form in the coming weeks. In **Somalia**, aerial control operations using biopesticides are making good progress against immature swarms on the northern plateau in Somaliland and Puntland. Further south, an increasing number of adult groups were reported in the central region of Galguduud in the past week. In **Yemen**, hopper bands and swarms continue to be present in the interior and are spreading to coastal areas in the south and on the Red Sea. Limited control operations were undertaken in some areas. ([FAO, 18 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3671532))\\n\\nImportant and widespread breeding continues in eastern **Ethiopia** and central **Somalia** where new swarms are expected to start forming in early December and move south to **Kenya** and southern Somalia by mid-December. Control operations are underway. In **Eritrea**, immature swarms that arrived from northern Ethiopia have scattered throughout the highlands to nearly the Sudan border. In **Sudan**, hopper bands and immature adult groups are persisting between the Red Sea Hills and the Atbara River. More immature swarms have been seen in the Tokar Delta on the Red Sea coast in the past few days. In **Yemen**, summer-bred swarms are still present in parts of the interior. On the 8th, a swarm was seen flying near Bayhan. ([FAO, 12 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3687289))\\n\\nAccording to a recent Government report, desert locust infestation in July has damaged 365,015 hectares of cropland, including 283,172 hectares in East and West Hararge zone of Oromia region (impacting 499,505 farmers) and 81,843 hectares in Oromo Special Zone, South Wollo, and North Wollo zones in Amhara region (impacting 795,774 farmers). Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions. The situation would have been much worse without the control operations that have increased over the month of October, treating an estimated 335,453 hectares of land across Ethiopia. ([OCHA, 20 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3690028))\\n\\nNumerous immature swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and central Somalia during December, which moved to southern Ethiopia, reaching northern Kenya on 21 December. More swarms will arrive during January and spread throughout southern Ethiopia and northern, central, and eastern counties of Kenya where they will mature and lay eggs that will hatch and give rise to hopper bands from late January onwards. ([FAO, 4 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3702574))\\n\\nIn **Kenya**, immature swarms persist mainly in northern and central counties. In the past five days, swarms have been reported in 15 counties. [...] A similar situation is underway in **Ethiopia** where immature swarms persist mainly in southern SNNP (South Omo) and east of the Rift Valley in Oromia (Bale, Borema, Arsi). [...] In **Somalia**, a few new immature swarms have started to form in the past few days from breeding in the northeast (Puntland) where hopper bands are still present. [...] In **Yemen**, scattered adults are maturing along the Red Sea coastal plains where small scale breeding could occur in the few areas that remain favourable. Current infestations are not high enough to warrant control operations. No surveys were conducted recently along the Gulf of Aden plains. ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3711808))\\n\\nIn **Kenya**, a few small immature swarms continue to be seen mainly in the Rift Valley of Nakuru county west of Mt. Kenya. There were also occasional swarm reports south of Nairobi and further north in Samburu county.  In **Ethiopia**, control operations continue against a few small immature swarms in the highlands east of the Rift Valley, mainly in Arsi district of Oromia region and, to a lesser extent, further north in East Harerghe district. The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))\\n\\nThe current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))\\n\\nDesert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))\\n\\nGround teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))\\n\\nAerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))\\n\\nThe locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))\\n\\nThe few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))\\n\\n A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))\\n\\nAs late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))\\n\\nAfter more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))\\n\\nThe current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained.

Its path is expected to pass over the northern tip of the Comoros islands on 24 April and continue onward to northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania. It is expected to make landfall in the district of Palma in Mozambique on 25 April...The Global Disaster Alert Coordination System (GDACS) has issued an [orange alert](http://www.gdacs.org/report.aspx?eventtype=TC&eventid=1000559&episodeid=7) for the Cyclone, meaning a medium humanitarian impact is expected based on the storm strength and its forecasted path. According to [UNOSAT](https://reliefweb.int/node/3094943), the entire population of Comoros (758,339) is within the Cyclone\\u2019s windspeed zones, with Grand Comore the primary concern. In Mozambique, more than 747,000 people are living within the Cyclone\\u2019s path, mainly in Cabo Delgado Province, including a projected 117,000 living in high wind speed zones.

Meanwhile, three districts in Zimbabwe and two districts in Madagascar were classified in Emergency (IPC phase 4) at the outset of the lean season, as a result of extreme loss of livelihood assets. There are also pockets of people facing Emergency food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique.  ([OCHA, 26 Nov 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2889353))\\n\\nSince the start of the 2018/19 cropping season in October, anomalous dry conditions have developed across parts of Southern Africa, with more intense moisture deficits registered in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa, in addition to the western parts of Madagascar. Although there are a few months remaining in the cropping season, with the main harvest period usually commencing in April, the impact of the reduced rains is expected to have caused a contraction in the area planted and lowered yield prospects, particularly in the aforementioned areas. Heavier rainfall since mid\\u2011December provided some respite and helped to alleviate moisture deficits, but concurrently resulted in localized flooding in parts of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ([GIEWS, 22 Jan 2019](https://reliefweb.int/node/2960209))\\n\\nApproximately 10.8 million people were facing severe food insecurity in Southern Africa as 2018 came to an end. In Eswatini, the estimated number of people facing Crisis (IPC phase 3) or worse food insecurity more than doubled from 120,000 in October to nearly 250,000 in December. In Zimbabwe, where 2.4 million people in rural areas were severely food insecure, the deteriorating economic situation caused sharp price increases and hampered access to food and agricultural inputs. Shortages of basic food commodities in formal markets, including cooking oil, sugar and bread, were reported, especially in remote areas. In Mozambique, more than 1.78 million people were in IPC phase 3 or above across the country, of whom 814,000 people in five provinces were prioritized for urgent humanitarian assistance. Further attacks by non-state armed actors were reported in Cabo Delgado province in November, increasing food security and malnutrition concerns.

Additionally, household access to milk will be lower than normal driven by poor livestock body conditions. Consequently, atypically high levels of acute food insecurity are likely during the 2019/20 lean season in most countries across the region, except in Madagascar, Malawi, and northern Mozambique. Atypically high needs will also be driven by conflict in DRC and poor macroeconomic conditions in Zimbabwe. Although outcomes are not expected to be as severe as those following the 2015/16 drought, humanitarian partners should prepare for a likely earlier than normal start to the 2019/20 lean season and higher than normal food assistance needs during this time.

Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern **Madagascar** due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado **Mozambique** and parts of the **DRCongo**. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, **DRCongo**, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government\\u2019s declaration of martial law. Conflict in **DRC** and **Mozambique** has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in **Zimbabwe**, **Malawi**, **Lesotho**, and most parts of **Mozambique** are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September. In areas where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, while the harvest is expected to facilitate improved food access, household income will most likely remain below average.

The cyclone is moving currently north-northwest at a speed of 11 km/h. Mekunu is expected to continue moving in this direction during the remainder of this week and make landfall near Salalah, Oman on about Saturday 26 May. A major fluctuation in tropical weather over the southern Arabian Sea known as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) is likely to cause Mekunu to strengthen further. As a result, heavy rains are forecasted for Socotra Island, followed by the southern Arabian coast from Sayhut in eastern Yemen to Salalah and Ash Shuwaymiyyah in southern Oman, which could cause local flooding and damage.

So far, this flood has affected the village of Kivava, especially in the suburbs of Sokoni and Kivukuni, villages of Angazo, and Kilamboma, and making 1,400 people displaced, representing 395 households affected in the suburbs of the market and the port. These 1,400 displaced people have been moved to temporary shelters in primary schools that are elevated due to their houses being surrounded by water. In addition, about 60 houses have collapsed with more than 100 toilets having collapsed and fields having been destroyed by water. The road from the village of Angazo to the village of Kilambo has been damaged, thus causing a lack of transportation and communication between those areas. Kivava village is one of the 110 villages in the district council. This village has 4 neighborhoods which are sokoni, kivukoni, dinanji, and lilumbi, the number of residents in this village is 1,976 and there are 518 households. The main economic activity in the village is agriculture and food business. The cultivated crops are rice, sorghum, cassava, cashews, coconuts, and legumes. Most of the agricultural areas were washed away by floods. TRCS branch (Mtwara Red Cross regional team) aside from local authorities visited the affected villages on 5th April and issued initial assessment data to start guiding the first emergency assistance to the affected communities through local actions. TRCS branch, further to this assessment provided first distributions and helped the local authorities in the initial food distribution.

            "  \"description\": \"The ongoing drought and compounding regional and international shocks resulting in high price volatility are affecting the food security and nutrition situation in Djibouti. Rural populations in Ali Sabieh, Arta, Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil are particularly exposed to extreme deprivation and no longer able to cope due to lack of access to main basic services as water, health, and education. Malnutrition rates are almost double from last year in at least one health center visited by DG ECHO in May 2022. Communities report the depletion of livestock assets, loss of body mass index, and lack of milk production followed by death of livestock. According to the latest IPC, approximately 13% of the population (132,000 people) is facing acute food insecurity (IPC3) and is in need of immediate assistance. Projections indicate an increase in food insecurity to 16% of the population by December 2022. ([ECHO, 7 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3854203))\\n\\nIPC projections for July to December 2022 indicate an increase in the number of acutely food insecure people, likely reaching 192,168 people, representing 16% of analysed population (1.2 million people, which is about the entire country). The number of people in emergency (IPC 4) will likely increase 12,390 people, a 250% rise from the current numbers, while the 179,778 people could be in crisis (IPC 3).\\n\\nCurrent IPC analysis for the period of March to June 2022, highlight that approximately 132,000 people, representing 11% of the analysed population (of nearly 1.2 million people), are estimated to be acutely food insecure (IPC Phase 3 and 4). More precisely, an estimated 5,000 people (less than one percent of the population analysed) are estimated to already be in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and approximately 127,000 people (11% of the population analysed) are in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([IFRC, 1 Jul 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3862372))\\n\\nAccording to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), about 285 000 people are estimated to face severe acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 [Crisis] and IPC Phase 4 [Emergency]) in the July\\u2011December 2023 period. This figure, which includes about 185,000 people in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 100,000 in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), amounts to about one\\u2011quarter of the country\\u2019s population and it is almost 50 percent higher on a yearly basis.The high prevalence and severity of acute food insecurity and the deterioration of the food security situation are mainly due to the lingering impact of a prolonged and severe drought, which affected livelihoods between late 2020 and early 2023, and resulted in a reduction of livestock numbers by about 50 percent due to widespread deaths, severely constraining incomes and availability of livestock products for pastoralist households.([FAO, 07 Aug 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3986886))\\n### Appeals & Response Plans\\n\\n- [![IFRC: Djibouti: Hunger Crisis - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF Operation no.

In Ayod County of Jonglei, some 30,000 people in at least six locations were affected by flooding, according to local authorities. A cumulative number of 18,000 people in Fangak County, Jonglei, were also affected by flooding between May and July. Floods affected more than 37,000 people in communities across Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Upper Nile and Warrap. Sub-national violence in Tambura County, Western Equatoria, displaced an estimated 21,000 people, mainly women and children, and killed some 150 people. ([OCHA, 6 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/https//:reliefweb.int/node/3762710))\\n\\nAs early season flooding unfolds in parts of South Sudan, the humanitarian community is working with the Government of South Sudan to support people affected by the rising waters. An estimated 90,000 people have been affected thus far, after heavy rains inundated homes and agricultural fields, forcing families and their livestock to higher ground. On 4 August, a mission comprising of humanitarian representatives and government officials from Juba and Bor visited Ayod and Canal counties to understand the impacts of the ongoing flooding and support required to assist the people. During the mission, local authorities reported that upwards of 70,000 people have been affected by flooding in Ayod and Canal counties. For many, this is the second time they have faced flooding since May. ([OCHA, UNHCR, 6 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3762813))\\n\\nSome 380,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the river Nile, Sudd wetlands and the rivers Lol and Sobat since May. **Jonglei** and **Unity** states are the worst affected. Early seasonal rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements across the top of the country, with more heavy rains and flooding expected in the coming months. Many of the flood-affected people moved to higher grounds within their county, and plan to return home once the flood waters recede. Some 100,000 people, mostly from **Twic East**, who were displaced by the 2020 floods, still have not returned home and are sheltering in the Bor and Mangalla IDP camps, and in Mingkaman, according to humanitarian partners. A coordinated humanitarian response scale-up in the most affected states of Jonglei, Unity, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap was initiated to respond to the increased needs of people affected and displaced by the flood waters. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3769688))\\n\\nAn estimated 426,000 people were affected and displaced by floods in South Sudan since May 2021. People in Jonglei and Unity states, followed by Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Upper Nile states have been the worst affected to date. Insecurity in Warrap State has made it difficult to respond to people\\u2019s needs there. According to initial assessments, priority needs include food assistance, emergency shelter and non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene services and hygiene kits, health and nutrition supplies and services, protection services and dignity kits, and fishing kits for livelihood support. ([OCHA, 15 Sep 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3775709))\\n\\nMore than 466,000 people have been reported to be affected by flooding in areas along the Nile and Lol rivers and Sudd marshlands since May.\\nThis reflects a 23 per cent increase in the numbers of people reported to be affected since the end of August.

([OCHA, 18 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3792894))\\n\\nWidespread flooding since May has continued to impact people and their livelihoods across South Sudan. More than 835,000 people were reported as affected by flooding in 33 of 78 counties, as of 8 December. The decrease in number from 854,000 at end November follows verification of the numbers of people impacted on Duk Islands where fewer people were found than those reported. Jonglei, Unity and Upper Niles remain the worst impacted states, with some 80 per cent of the total cumulative number of affected people. Jonglei is the hardest hit with 305,000 people affected, followed by Unity (220,000 affected) and Upper Nile (141,000 affected). ([OCHA, 14 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3800557))\\n\\nThe country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don\\u2019t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. ([IFRC, 25 Jan 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3811293))\\n\\nMost communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 \\u2013 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.  ([IFRC, 2 Jun 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3853155))\\n\\nFlooding and heavy rains continue to impact people across the country, including Jonglei, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Upper Nile, Warrap, and Western Equatoria states. Eastern Equatoria and Western Equatoria states that have not been affected by 2021 floods are now reported flooded. In Unity, floodwater levels have risen above the level measured in 2021 by 10 centimeters. Reports indicate that heavy rains and floods have destroyed crops, people\\u2019s homes, schools, health care centres, boreholes and killed people. An estimated 386,000 people have been affected based on assessments that were conducted in 18 of the 27 counties reportedly impacted by floods. ([OCHA, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3889251))\\n\\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting Western Equatoria State (south-western South Sudan) over the past days, causing floods and river overflow (in particular the Mori River) that have resulted in evacuations and damage. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) reports, as of 28 September, nearly 29,800 displaced people, a number of whom have been relocated to higher and safer grounds, mainly across Mundri West County (eastern Western Equatoria State). Humanitarian efforts are underway to aid displaced communities. ([ECHO, 19 Sep 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3891067))\\n\\nSince late August, heavy rains and flooding impact people across the country and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area, with over 900,000 people reportedly affected. Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms. However, insecurity, violence against aid workers and access constraints continue to hamper the overall floods response. ([ECHO, 13 Oct 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3895776))\\n\\nSince July 2022, an estimated 1 million people were affected by severe flooding in 36 counties across South Sudan and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area.  \\nFlood waters continue to block humanitarian access in Unity State, especially in the southern part of the state including Bentiu and into Jonglei State. An estimated 7 380 people are displaced by flooding in areas of Rubkona county. ([WHO, 27 Apr 2023](https://reliefweb.int/node/3956535))\",\n",

Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May, and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages. [(OCHA, 9 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3736896)    \\n\\nThe recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar. [(OCHA, 17 May 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3738815)\\n\\nThe ongoing Gu\\u2019 rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week. The latest forecast indicates that the continuation of these rains from late May through June is uncertain. However, the rains received triggered flash floods in some areas and will affect food security and livelihoods, with the 2021 Gu\\u2019 season cereal production expected to be 20-40% below average.

In April, another 305 cases tested positive out of 315 (97% positivity rate). The adjacent Lamu county has also reported a total of 224 positive cases from different health facilities where 59 are children under 5 years old. Cumulatively, 553 cases have been reported within the past 4 months of January, February, March and April, with a peak of cases in April. No deaths have been reported so far within the two counties. In both counties, cases are on the rise and urgent action needs to be taken to prevent an all-out outbreak which would endanger the lives of the population, causing a health disaster. Public health officials are warning that more cases should be expected as the seasonal \\u2018long rains\\u2019 run through to the end of May, boosting mosquito populations. Previous outbreak data and monthly trends show that annual upsurges are experienced after the short and long rainfall seasons with dual peaks in February and June. The usual trend is that the next peak would occur in June, after the long rains have subdued; however, in this case, the virus is surging at the beginning of the long rains, which will most likely make the situation worse as conditions become more conducive for the mass spread of the disease vector. There is also concern about a new variant of Dengue fever. A specialized team of experts from the Ministry of Health has been deployed in Mombasa county on 4 May 2021 to investigate this new variant of Dengue fever.

While laboratory tests are still ongoing, positive environmental samples of poliovirus type 2 have also been found in seven more states, including West Darfur, East Darfur, Gezira, White Nile, River Nile, Khartoum and Red Sea, indicating a possible wide circulation of the virus within the country. At least 5.2 million children under age 5 live in the affected states and will require urgent vaccination. The outbreak, the first since March 2009, has been considered by the authorities as a national emergency and response has been activated to tackle the high risk of transmissions within and beyond Sudan, including South Sudan, declared by WHO as polio-free just a month ago. Neighbouring Ethiopia, Central African Republic and Chad also reported cases, which puts more risks on Sudan, especially in the Darfur region, due to border movements. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current floods in Sudan will likely increase the challenges for Government and humanitarian partners to contain the new outbreak.

([FEWSNET, 4 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658961/))\\n\\nEngineering troops serving with the UN Mission in South Sudan are engaged in an ongoing battle against flooding caused by broken dykes in Bor, in Jonglei, aggravated by heavy downpours. Across the state, primarily in Bor South and Twic East, some 135,000 people are believed to be displaced.([UNMISS, 8 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3660060/))\\n\\nThe situation is worsened by the onset of the rainy season, which has led to the displacement of over 5,000 people due to floods in Bor South and Twic East counties in Jonglei. According to local authorities, the number goes up to 150,000 for eastern Jonglei. ([ECHO, 11 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3660709/))\\n\\nHeavy rainfall has been affecting central and eastern States of the country (in particular Jonglei, Eastern Nile, and Pibor States) since late July, causing the White Nile River, and the Akobo River to overflow, triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. In Jonglei State, media report as of 14 August, around 200,000 displaced people, and thousands of destroyed houses across Bor South, Twic East, Duk, and Ayod Counties. In the eastern part of Upper Nile State, approximately 30,000 people were reported affected across the Renk County. In Pibor state, a number of families were reported displaced throughout Pochalla County. ([ECHO, 14 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3661817/))\\n\\nMore than 600,000 people have been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July, with Jonglei and Lakes the worst affected states. Heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements along the White Nile in the centre of the country.The majority of people displaced moved to higher ground near their homes and plan to return once the flood waters recede. In Bor South, over 33,000 people earlier displaced by conflict and flooding in Twic East and Duk counties to the north have moved west into Awerial county, and are now sheltering in Mingkaman town IDP settlement. ([OCHA, 3 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3667252/))\\n\\nWidespread flooding continued in October, affecting over half of the country and disrupting the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. An estimated 856,000 people were affected by flooding since July with some 400,000 people displaced. ([OCHA, 6 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3686200/))\\n\\nAn estimated 1,042,000 people have been affected by floods in South Sudan. Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area are the worst affected (a total of 495,000 people affected). Flood-affected people\\u2019s urgent needs include food and livelihood support, emergency shelter and non-food items (ES/NFI), and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and protection services. Flood-response activities have been considerably constrained by persistent heavy rains, infrastructure damage and reduced physical accessibility and insecurity. There is an urgent need for additional logistic support with dedicated air assets and riverine transport to transport cargo to multiple locations prioritized for flood response.

Khartoum, Blue Nile and River Nile are amongst the most affected states. Floods have also led to damages and affected people in other regions, including El Gezira, West Kordofan and South Darfur. In the Blue Nile State, the state with highest number of people affected so far, the Bout Earth Dam, in Tadamon locality, exceeded its full capacity and collapsed, following the strong rainfall received on 29 July. At least 12 neighbourhoods downstream in Bout Town were flooded due the incident, affecting around 3,900 people. Most of them were rendered homeless and are now sheltering with host families, as nearly 190 houses were destroyed and 590 damaged, according to Government\\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). More houses are expected to collapse, as the rains continue in a zone where the land is already extremely wet. ([OCHA, 3 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658542)).\\n\\nHeavy rain continues to affect 14 of the 18 States, causing widespread floods and leading to an increasing number of casualties and damage. According to UN OCHA, at least 1,100 people have been displaced (600 in North Darfur, and 500 in White Nile State) and more than 50,000 people affected. In addition, media report 10 deaths, 3 injured and more than 3,000 houses destroyed or damaged. National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected. For the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is expected across southern States. Sudan's Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rain is expected over August and September, which risks leading to further flooding and displacement. ([ECHO, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659785))\\n\\nAn estimated 125,000 refugees and internally displaced people have been affected in total, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance. Rains have been particularly heavy in North Darfur, leaving an estimated 35,000 IDPs, locals and refugees in need of help, and where 15 people have tragically died and a further 23 gone missing. ([UNHCR, 1 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3666438))\\n\\nAs of 8 September, [there were] nearly 100 fatalities, 46 injured people, thousands of people displaced (and many of them sheltered in schools), and over 100,000 houses destroyed or damaged across the aforementioned States. Since mid-July, around 506,000 people have been affected across 17 States (out of 18), with more than 110,000 of them during the first week of September. In the Khartoum State around 100,000 people are currently in need of urgent shelters, household supplies, clean water, sanitation, and health services. Over the next 24 hours, moderate rain is forecast over south-west and south-east Sudan, with locally heavy rain over central North Kordofan State. ([ECHO, 9 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3668741))\\n\\nAt least 111,000 houses were either destroyed or severely damaged by floodwater and the number of people critically affected exceeds 770,000. Nearly 16,000 latrines were destroyed and the collapse of the Bout Dam hinders access to water to more than 100,000 people in Blue Nile State, but all 18 States of the country have been affected. There is a need for food, shelter, hygiene and sanitation items to assist those affected. Two weeks ago, the Government declared a State of Emergency in the country due to the unprecedented flooding. Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. ([ECHO, 22 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672284))\\n\\nRains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.

            "  \"description\": \"The 2020 Gu\\u2019 rains (April-June) have intensified across Somalia, triggering flash flooding in South West State, Jubaland, Bandir, Puntland and Somaliland from 20-23 April. As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO\\u2019s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation. [OCHA, 24 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3618914))\\n\\nSince 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). ([ECHO, 29 Apr 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3625054))\\n\\nThe number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu\\u2019 rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. ([OCHA, 11 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3633360))\\n\\nOngoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. ([OCHA, 16 May 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3635539))\\n\\nAs of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3641339))\\n\\nFlash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. ([OCHA, 26 Jul 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3658337))\\n\\nThe latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia\\u2019s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. ([UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3659748))\\n\\nRiverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

Separate reports indicated that similar infestations have destroyed 95 hectares of cropland in Afar region, as well as 132,596 hectares of cropland and 283,457 hectares of pastureland in Amhara region. Widespread locust breading activities is currently witnessed in eastern Ethiopia. While, few immature swarms persist in Afar region, the immature swarms between Jijiga and Degehabur in Somali region are more of concern, as some are maturing. With this development, the epicenter of the locust seems to have moved from northern Ethiopia to eastern Ethiopia as the hopper bands in the North have moved to **Eritrea** and good rainfall in eastern **Ethiopia** has created favorable breeding conditions.

The situation has calmed down in southern Oromia and SNNP. In **Somalia**, control operations are continuing in the northeast (Puntland) against some immature swarms on the plateau northwest of Iskushuban. In the northwest (Somaliland), scattered immature adults are present on the plateau between Hargeisa and Burao. In northern **Tanzania**, small-scale hatching occurred northwest of Arusha from remnants of mature swarms that laid eggs at the beginning of March. In **Saudi Arabia**, locust infestations declined on the northern Red Sea coast.  ([FAO, 9 Feb 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725187))\\n\\nThe current upsurge showed signs of significant decline during March as Desert Locust swarms continued to decrease in **Kenya**, **Ethiopia** and **Somalia** due to ongoing control operations and poor rainfall... Limited breeding occurred in northeast **Tanzania** from remnants of earlier swarms. Although winter-bred infestations declined along both side of the Red Sea, late hatching and hopper band formation occurred in **Sudan**. More importantly, widespread hatching and hopper band formation took place in the interior of **Saudi Arabia** where control operations combined with earlier than normal dry and hot conditions should be able to reduce these infestations. In addition, strong winds carried a few small mature swarms to **Kuwait** and southwest **Iran**. This could lead to hatching and band formation in southwest Iran during April and May. ([FAO, 3 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727046))\\n\\nDesert Locust swarms are continuing to decline in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia as a result of ongoing control operations. However, good rains have fallen this month in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia that should allow current swarms to mature and lay eggs. This is likely to give rise to hatching and the formation of hopper bands during May. ([FAO, 13 Apr 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3729511))\\n\\nGround teams are detecting an increasing number of early instar hopper bands that are forming in eastern Ethiopia and northwest Somalia as more eggs hatch. This will continue until about mid-June as mature swarms are still laying eggs in some places. Ground and aerial control operations are in progress. In Saudi Arabia, control operations continue in the spring breeding areas of the interior where groups of immature adults have formed and are likely to move south to Yemen for eventual breeding in the interior. So far, a few groups have already migrated to within about 100 km of Yemen. A new round of breeding signifies the potential for a further increase in locust numbers in the Horn of Africa. If hopper band infestations are not adequately detected and treated, new smarms could form from late June onwards and move west during July to the Afar region in northeast Ethiopia for summer breeding. Locust numbers could build up in the interior of Yemen that may eventually threaten the Horn of Africa. ([FAO, 27 May 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3742187))\\n\\nAerial control operations continue against a few small immature swarms on the plateau in northwest Somalia while one swarm was seen in the northeast. Limited swarm breeding is thought to be underway in northern Ethiopia where good rains have fallen, but the security situation has deteriorated in the Afar region during the past week, hampering survey and control operations by air and ground. In Yemen, small-scale breeding is underway in the interior. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm, and no significant developments are likely. Swarms are not likely to move from Ethiopia and Somalia to Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia now. Instead, the swarms in northern Somalia may move back and forth across the Ethiopia / Somalia border where they are likely to persist and remain immature due to dry conditions. ([FAO, 12 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3764552))\\n\\nThe locust situation remains serious in the Horn of Africa and Yemen. As anticipated, new immature swarms began to form after mid-September in the summer breeding areas of northeast Ethiopia and most likely in adjacent areas of the northern highlands where hopper bands were reported. The scale of the breeding is not well known, and control operations could not be conducted due to insecurity. Although limited field operations began to resume in some areas by the end of the month, more small immature swarms will form in Afar, Tigray, and Amhara regions of Ethiopia during October. As vegetation dries out, they will migrate north through the highlands to Eritrea and the Red Sea coast as well as east perhaps through Djibouti at times to eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia. October rains that are expected in the Somali region of eastern Ethiopia and adjacent plateau and coastal areas of northern Somalia will allow the summer-bred swarms and the remaining spring-bred swarms to mature and lay eggs, giving rise to hatching and hopper band formation from about early November onwards. Similarly, any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Eritrea from northern Ethiopia are likely to mature and breed once winter rains commence. Although limited control operations were carried out in the interior of Yemen, more small swarms are expected to form and move to coastal areas along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for eventual breeding. A few swarms may cross to northern Somalia while any swarms that reach the Red Sea coast of Yemen could continue to adjacent coastal areas of southwest Saudi Arabia. Elsewhere, the situation is calm. ([FAO, 1 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3779180))\\n\\nThe few spring-bred swarms that have remained in northeast Somalia are now mature and starting to copulate. No swarms have been reported recently in northwest Somalia, Djibouti, or Ethiopia. Nevertheless, a few summer-bred swarms are likely to have formed in parts of Afar and adjacent areas of southeast Tigray and eastern Amhara regions. Unfortunately, this cannot be confirmed as most areas are not accessible. No surveys have been conducted recently in Yemen where a few summer-bred swarms are likely to be present in parts of the interior. In Sudan, only low numbers of scattered adults are present in the interior with local breeding in the Bayuda Desert north of Khartoum where a few groups are forming as vegetation dries out. Elsewhere, the situation remains calm. ([FAO, 14 Oct 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3782739))\\n\\n A few small mature swarms, most likely those that arrived on the Ethiopia/Kenya border earlier this month, have concentrated in southern Ethiopia between Konso and the Kenya border where control operations are underway. There have been no further reports of locusts in Kenya and elsewhere in Ethiopia. Aerial and ground control operations continue against small hopper bands in northeast Somalia while scattered adults persist in the northwest. ([FAO, 24 Nov 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3794507))\\n\\nAs late instar hopper bands continue to fledge, more new small immature swarms are forming in northeast Somalia where aerial and ground control operations are in progress north of Garowe. Limited aerial control operations continue against a few small immature and mature swarms that persist in the Rift Valley of SNNP near the Kenya border. Low numbers of solitarious locusts are present in winter breeding areas along both sides of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden coast of northwest Somalia, and limited breeding has started in a few places. ([FAO, 23 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3803783))\\n\\nAfter more than two years, the current Desert Locust upsurge has finally declined. Aerial control operations against the few small immature swarms that remained in northeast **Somalia** ended on 4 January. During the remainder of the month, no locusts were seen in **Ethiopia** and **Kenya**, and southerly migration was not detected. As ecological conditions are dry due to a lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa, the likelihood of any further developments in the region is low but vigilance is suggested during February. Adding to the collapse of the upsurge, poor rains have limited winter breeding to a small area along both sides of the **Egypt/Sudan** border on the Red Sea coast. While small-scale breeding may occur during February on the coastal plains near the **Sudan/Eritrea** border and in a few places on the **Saudi Arabia** and **Yemen** coast, it is likely to be limited and should not cause a significant increase in locusts.  ([FAO, 1 Feb 2022](https://reliefweb.int/node/3813540))\\n\\nThe current Desert Locust upsurge has finally ended in the Horn of Africa after more than two years of intensive survey and control operations carried out by ground and air with generous support from the international community. For nearly the second consecutive month, no significant locust infestations have been detected in **Djibouti**, **Eritrea**, **Ethiopia**, **Somalia**, and **Kenya** during February. Although rain has not fallen recently and ecological conditions are dry, small groups of immature adults were seen moving southwards in eastern Ethiopia, which suggests that a few residual infestations may still be present. Therefore, surveys and vigilance should be maintained.

In the current period, seven districts are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3 ) with the exception of Butha-Buthe, Leribe and Berea, where around 560,000 people are classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and require support to maintain their livelihoods. ([IPC, 28 Aug 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3665618))\\n\\nBetween October 2020 and March 2021, **Zambia\\u2019s** food security situation is expected to deteriorate, as this coincides with the lean season, when more households will rely on the market for food. It is projected that about 1.98 million people (29% of the analysed population) will be facing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above) and require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. [IPC, 01 Dec 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3693051))\\n\\n\\nBy the end of the year, severe food insecurity was affecting 13.6 million people across 11 countries, and this will rise during the lean season (January to March 2021). In the Grand Sud of **Madagascar**, over 900,000 people faced severe food insecurity from October to December due to back-to-back droughts, compounded by COVID-19 and displacements due to the growing insecurity related to cattle raiding. Hunger will increase and affect 1.14 million from January to April 2021. In **Mozambique**, conflict in Cabo Delgado Province\\u2014which had displaced more than 500,000 people by end-October\\u2014and drought in the semi-arid southern and central areas of the country drove Crisis (IPC Phase 3) levels of food insecurity. In **Zimbabwe**, 2.6 million people were severely food insecure from October to December 2020 due to the prevailing economic situation and erratic rainfall, and 3.4 million people are projected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or Emergency (IPC Phase 4) from January to March 2021. Without the humanitarian assistance delivered in **Zimbabwe** in 2020, these figures would be much higher, according to the IPC analysis. [OCHA, 19 Jan 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3705562))\\n\\nAccording to the acute food insecurity analysis update in Zambia for the February-March 2021 projection period, an estimated 1.73 million people (25% of the analysed population) are likely to face high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). This includes around 1.5 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and around 240,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4), who will require urgent humanitarian action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods. [IPC, 12 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3725812))\\n\\nAround 27.3 million people in the **Democratic Republic of Congo** are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), making the central African country the host of the highest number of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in the world.  [IPC, 30 Mar 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3720764))\\n\\n**Angola** has been experiencing episodes of drought since December last year with below average rainfall in the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Benguela, Huambo, Namibe and Hu\\u00edla. The situation is not expected to improve in the coming months in the absence of above average rainfall. Since the beginning of March 2021, Angolans living in the border provinces of Cunene and Huila are crossing into Namibia at illegal entry points in Omusati and Ohangwena regions in search of food, water, medical services and employment opportunities. The regional councils (local authorities) have recorded altogether 894 people in Omusati and Kunene regions who have crossed into Namibia in search of food. [(IFRC, 6 Apr 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3727576)\\n\\n**Mozambique**: In the 16 analysis units analysed in Cabo Delgado Province, in total, it is estimated that about 75,000 children aged 6-59 months are suffering and are likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in the next 12 months and, consequently, need and will need treatment. In terms of severity of the situation, for the period October 2020 to March 2021, corresponding to the season when the survey was conducted (February 2021), eight districts and two IDP centres were classified in Alert (IPC AMN Phase 2), five districts and one IDP centre were classified in Acceptable (IPC AMN Phase 1). Projection analyses of the situation indicate, that for the period April to September 2021, in districts with limited or no humanitarian access, by the end of the projection period, the situation is likely to deteriorate to Critical (IPC AMN Phase 4) in one district, to Serious (IPC AMN Phase 3) in three districts, and to Alert in four districts. [(IFRC, 9 Jun 2021)](https://reliefweb.int/node/3745819)\\n\\nCrisis! (IPC Phase 3!) outcomes are widespread across much of southern **Madagascar**, with some households experiencing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and worst-affected households in Ambovombe and Amboasary experiencing Catastrophe ((IPC Phase 5). Minimal seasonal improvement in food access is expected in southern **Madagascar** due to the expected limited harvest and associated income-earning opportunities. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes with some households in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) are expected to persist through at least September. Conflict continues at relatively high levels in Cabo Delgado **Mozambique** and parts of the **DRCongo**. According to OCHA, as of April, over 732,000 people were displaced in Cabo Delgado. In Kasai, **DRCongo**, in March, about 41,000 were displaced due to conflict. Additionally, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, recent conflict has resulted in the government\\u2019s declaration of martial law. Conflict in **DRC** and **Mozambique** has disrupted agricultural and most typical livelihood activities with minimal seasonal improvements expected with the harvest. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected in these areas through at least September. As the harvest continues across most of the region, most households, including the poor, are consuming foods from their own production. Overall, households in **Zimbabwe**, **Malawi**, **Lesotho**, and most parts of **Mozambique** are anticipated to experience Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) through at least September. In areas where Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes, while the harvest is expected to facilitate improved food access, household income will most likely remain below average.

The organization highlighted how the creation of commercial cattle ranches on community land has driven pastoralist communities from their land since the end of the civil war in 2002 - a shift which left huge sections of the population food insecure and paved the way for a humanitarian crisis as the acute drought persists for over three years when drought struck over three years ago. As food and water grow increasingly scarce, thousands have fled their homes and sought refuge in neighbouring Namibia. ([Amnesty, 22 Jul 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3758243))\\n\\nThe latest IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis results indicate that between July and September 2021, about 1.18 million people in **Zambia** are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). Flooding, high maize prices, and pests drive the country\\u2019s acute food insecurity despite a good harvest. The highly food insecure population requires urgent humanitarian assistance to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. The situation has particularly deteriorated in the Western province, where five districts were classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3).  ([IPC, 18 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3766122))\\n\\n\\nOver 1 million people in **Malawi** are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in Crisis (IPC Phase between July and September 2021. Despite Malawi\\u2019s record high maize production of 46% above the five-year average, some pockets in these districts and cities experienced severe dry spells and earlier than normal tailing of rainfall. This led to localized production shortfalls coupled with the impact of COVID-19 on remittances, petty trade and self-employment activities. The population experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity require urgent action to reduce food gaps, protect and restore livelihoods and prevent acute malnutrition. Around 3.6 million people are classified in Stressed (IPC Phase 2), experiencing a mild level of food insecurity, while 14.1 million people are food secure-- Minimal (IPC Phase 1). All the four urban zones analyzed (Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Zomba) are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while the rural areas are in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) \\u2013 16 areas out of the 28 analyzed - or in IPC Phase 1 (none/minimal). ([IPC, 26 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3768490))\\n\\nThe worst drought in the last 40 years and rising food prices have resulted in high acute food insecurity in the Cunene, Huila and Namibe provinces of South-Western **Angola**. An IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis of 17 municipalities of Southern **Angola** found that, between July and September 2021, around 1.32 million people (49% of the analysed population) have experienced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), of which 38% are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) and 12% in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). These people face difficulties in accessing food or are only able to meet the minimum food requirements through crisis and/or emergency coping strategies. Between October 2021 and March 2022, the number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above is expected to rise to around 1.58 million people (58% of the analysed population), of which 42% are likely in IPC Phase 3 and 15% in IPC Phase 4. Three of the municipalities are also expected to move to a worse phase (Chicomba, Mo\\u00e7\\u00e2medes and T\\u00f4mbua).

Around 4.4 million people are Stressed (IPC Phase 2) while 13.1 million people are food secure (IPC Phase 1). Out of all rural districts, district towns and cities analysed, 26 areas are classified in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) while six are classified in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). No areas are classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Out of the 1.4 million people in Crisis (IPC Phase 3), around 186,000 are from urban areas (Mzuzu, Lilongwe, Zomba and Blantyre cities), representing 8% of the urban population, whilst the remaining 1.2 million people are from the rural areas and the Bomas, representing 7% of the rural and Boma population. ([IPC, 28 Dec 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3804491))\\n\\nOverall, there is concern for the 2021/22 season as rainfall through mid-December has been significantly below average across **Madagascar**, **Malawi**, central and northern **Mozambique**, and northwestern **Zimbabwe**. Across these areas, drought conditions are ongoing to start the season. Land preparation activities are delayed, and planting has yet to begin across many areas as of November. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are ongoing across rainfall deficit areas and areas of northern **Mozambique** and eastern **DRC** impacted by continued conflict.
