This was the first time that the capital city of Sudan, home to 6 million people, was at the epicentre of a fierce conflict between two powerful groups, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). 

Clashes broke out in different areas of the country and the relentless urban conflict has now taken at least 459  lives, many of them civilians, and injured over 5,000 people. 

Millions of civilians caught in the crossfire have been in lockdown for nearly two weeks, and many have run out of basic supplies like food, water, and medicine, having instead to borrow them or take the risk of fleeing through extremely dangerous routes. 

The conflict has also taken a significant toll on public infrastructure, with the destruction of hospitals and health facilities, leaving only 16 percent  of these facilities operating regularly in Khartoum. Residential buildings, water infrastructure, and energy infrastructure have been damaged as well, with continued disruption of service, while communications and internet connectivity have also been compromised. Both private and public facilities have been ransacked, and some burnt down, including on the premises of SRCS.  

The latest ceasefire has partially held, allowing evacuations to take place and some families to restock. However, food and water shortages, and lack of fuel, are leading to sharp increases in the cost of these basic commodities, while the price of transportation out of conflict areas is unaffordable for many. Families are prioritising the evacuation of women and children, who are exposed to heightened risks including sexual and gender-based violence, as reported by women-led organisations in Sudan . 

After 15 days of uninterrupted fighting, the full extent of the humanitarian situation is yet to be determined, but to date this conflict has put at least 9 million Sudanese, chiefly those living near the clashes, under severe hardship, unable to access emergency healthcare or medicines for those suffering from chronic conditions. The health facilities that remain functional lack staff and equipment, and the available blood is at risk due to power cuts in the cold chain. Women who are about to give birth cannot access ante-natal care and may be at risk of delivering without medical supervision. Lack of access to potable water is also leading people to seek water from the Nile, which could lead to a spike in diarrhoeal diseases, and will have repercussions on the nutrition status of children and pregnant and lactating women. 

Widespread displacement is ongoing, mainly in Khartoum, Northern State, North Kordofan, North Darfur, West Darfur, and South Darfur. There are chaotic scenes in Port Sudan and Wadi Halfa bordering Egypt, with people stranded for several days at a time attempting to leave the country. Displacement has also affected refugees living in Sudan, with many sheltering in crowded camps in White Nile State, Gedaref, and Kassala.
